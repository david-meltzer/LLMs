0,"### Human: What is the purpose of the 7.62 x 39mm cartridge?
 ### Assistant: The 7.62x39mm (also known as .30 Soft Point) cartridge was designed by Soviets in the late 1940s for their new semi-automatic rifle, the AK-47. It fires a small bullet at high speed and has low recoil. This makes it ideal for use with an assault rifle or carbine that can be fired quickly. It also means less weight to carry around than larger calibres such as .308 Winchester or 5.56 NATO which are used on other types of guns like bolt action sniper rifles or full auto machine guns respectively. Because this round does not need much power behind its projectile because most targets will be killed before reaching them anyway so there's no point shooting something bigger than what you would normally shoot at home when hunting game animals outdoors where accuracy matters more than stopping power since distance isn't usually too great between yourself & your prey unless going after big game animals during open season months only then might one consider using heavier rounds due primarily towards safety concerns rather than effectiveness ones though even still many hunters prefer lighter loads simply because they don't want unnecessary wear & tear done onto either themselves nor their equipment/firearm(s). In addition, some countries have strict laws regarding how heavy ammunition may legally be carried while others allow almost anything provided proper licensing procedures were followed first beforehand making sure all parties involved understand exactly what kind of firepower could potentially happen if things went wrong somehow downrange somewhere else along those same lines again just depending upon local regulations set forth pertaining thereto specifically speaking here now finally ending up back once again safely home sweet home base camp grounds area etcetera ad infinitum until next time hopefully sooner rather later someday soon maybe never who knows really depends entirely upon individual circumstances involved within each unique situation presented throughout course entirety entire life span lived fully experiencing everything possible without regret sadness sorrow pain suffering loss hope joy happiness love laughter tears crying laughing dancing singing humming whistling flute playing piano violin guitar ukulele banjo mandolin accordion harmonica saxophone trumpet trombone clarinet tuba french horn oboe bassoon piccolo recorder ocarina kazoo didgeridoo panpipe bagpipes shofar conch shell shellhorn noseflute j"

2,"### Human: What was the name of the French colony that later became the Republic of Dahomey?
 ### Assistant: The Colonie du Sud-Ouest Africain (Colony of Southwest Africa) or Côte d'Or (Gold Coast), and then the République Française de l’Afrique Occidentale, or RFAO for short, was a French colony in West Africa. It is now called Benin. In 1958 it got independence from France as the Republic of Dahomey. Then in 1975 its name changed to the People's Republic of Benin. Later it has been known by its current name since 2003. Geography 
Benin had an area of about . Its coastline on the Gulf of Guinea stretched along the Atlantic Ocean from Cape Three Points at latitude 4°N to Ouidah at latitude 6°N. This made up more than half the country's total length. To the north lay Togo, to the east Nigeria, and to the west Burkina Faso and Upper Volta. Climate 
The climate of the former French colonies was tropical, with high humidity and heavy rainfall year round. There were two seasons: dry season (November–March) and wet season (April–October). Average annual rainfall ranged from 1,000 mm near Cotonou to 2,000 mm in the forest zone. Temperatures remained fairly constant throughout the year; average daily maxima varied between 29 °C and 32 °C, while nightly minima fluctuated only slightly around 20 °C. The mean relative humidity hovered above 70 percent during most months. During the wet season, daytime temperatures rarely exceeded 30 °C because of cloud cover. At this time the equatorial sun never reached beyond the middle of the sky. Evenings were cooler, especially when there was rain. However, the temperature dropped below 20 °C only one month out of every twelve. By contrast, the dry season brought hot days and chilly evenings. Night frosts occurred occasionally in the interior plateau region but not in the lowlands. Vegetation 
In the late nineteenth century much of southern Benin consisted of savanna woodland, although some areas still contained patches of dense bush. Palm trees grew close together in thick groves. Grass"
3,"### Human: What is the name and some characteristics of a moon of Saturn?
 ### Assistant: Methone (), or Saturn XXIV, is one of the moons of Saturn. It was found by Brett J. Gladman et al in 2001 from images taken with Hubble Space Telescope between August 4 and September 5, 2000. This moon has not been given an official number yet because it does not follow the guidelines for naming set up by the International Astronomical Union. The guidelines say that only Cronian satellites discovered before 1963 can have letters after their names, while all other moons must be named using numbers alone. Because Methone's discovery came so late there are still many gaps left to fill in its orbit, making it difficult to decide where it fits into this system. For now, astronomers will just keep calling it ""Methone"". Its designation comes from Greek mythology; it means ""the third one"" which refers to being the third daughter born out of Zeus' head when he cut open his skull looking for Athena who had already escaped him through his nose hole. She became known as Pallas Athene after her mother Metis gave birth inside Zeus' brain cavity instead of outside like normal babies do! In Roman times she was called Minerva but we know her better today under either spelling depending on what language you speak. Her twin brother Ares also got himself killed by Diomedes during battle at Troy while trying protecting Paris from Achilles who wanted revenge against Helen because Menelaus said no more than once upon meeting them both face-to-face back home again...which led directly into another war between Trojans & Greeks over ownership rights over stolen goods/treasure trove etc.,etc.. That story goes way beyond scope here though ;) So let me get back onto topic - Methone itself measures about 7km across diameterwise & orbits around our planet every 2 years 8 months approximately speaking since nobody knows exactly how long each day lasts due lack reliable data available thus far collected regarding same subject matter...orbitally speaking anyway lolz! Anyway enough rambling done now lets talk science shall we?? :D How did scientists find this tiny object among millions others scattered throughout space without even knowing existed until recently??? Well basically they used something called occultations technique which involves tracking light coming off distant stars when viewed through telescopes located"
4,"### Human: What is the Rambla de las Ovejas and where is it located?
 ### Assistant: The Rambla de las Ovejas (Spanish for Sheep Trail) is a river in Spain. It flows through Andalusia, specifically the province of Córdoba. Geography 
The source of this river is near the town of Palenciana, at an altitude of about . From there, the water runs southward until reaching the Guadalquivir River, on which it empties after flowing past the towns of Almodóvar del Río, Peñarroya-Pueblonuevo and Villanueva de la Reina. This last town marks the border with the province of Jaén. Its total length is approximately , while its average depth is between and . When the rains are abundant, the Rambla can cause floods that affect all these municipalities. In the year 2014, there was a very serious one due to heavy rain caused by Tropical Storms Cristobal and Danya. During these days, most roads were closed because they had been damaged or covered by mudslides. There were also several deaths from drowning. These events affected many people who live along the banks of the Rambla, such as those living in El Viso, a hamlet belonging to the municipality of Villanueva de la Reina. A few years before, another similar event occurred during September 2013. That time, however, no lives were lost. Since then, some improvements have been made to prevent future disasters like this one. For example, there has been construction work done so that new bridges could be built over parts of the riverbed where they used to exist but disappeared during previous storms. Also, more than two thousand hectares were planted with trees around both sides of the Rambla's course; this helped stabilize slopes prone to landslides. Finally, concrete barriers were installed alongside certain sections of the stream bed to protect against possible erosion problems caused by strong currents when water levels rise quickly due to excessive amounts of precipitation falling within short periods of time. On January 9th 2017, once again extreme weather conditions led to severe flash flooding across southern Spain including La Mancha region where villages got completely submerged underwater leaving behind only rooves visible above surface level due massive amount of sediment deposited onto ground making access difficult without proper equipment needed"
5,"### Human: What is an anvil used for?
 ### Assistant: An anvil is a large metal block with a flat top. It is used in smithing to shape or cut metals by hammer blows from the other end of the tool, which may be called a sledgehammer or maul. The anvil's hardness and strength allow it to stand up to repeated strikes without deforming itself or cracking under the stress. Its mass also helps prevent damage to the work piece during heavy operations such as cutting through thick bars of steel plate. A modern blacksmith's shop will have several anvils at different sizes so that they can make things ranging from small nails all the way up to huge pieces like farm implements or even cars!  In ancient times when there were no machines yet invented people would use their hands instead - sometimes using tools made out of bones if necessary; this process was known as ""hand-forging"". Today we still see some examples around us though most are not very big because our technology has improved greatly since then allowing us more options than ever before but none compare quite as well as having something done properly by hand where possible especially when dealing with delicate materials like glassware etcetera...which require precision craftsmanship rather than brute force alone (although both methods certainly come into play). So next time you go shopping remember how lucky you truly are living today compared those who came before us centuries ago when life wasn't nearly halfway easy nor convenient either!
 
The word 'anvil' comes from Latin angulus meaning cornerstone or pivot point. This makes sense given its importance within any trade involving metalworking whether it involves making jewelry or repairing machinery parts alike due to being able to support heavy loads while providing enough space between them for proper alignment before striking off excess material away until reaching desired dimensions/shapes respectively.""
 
Anvils are usually cast iron although steel ones exist too depending upon what type(s)of alloys one wishes create certain effects e.g.: harder surfaces tend towards brittleness whereas soft ones offer greater resistance against wear over longer periods thus prolonging useful lifespans accordingly speaking overall benefits depend largely individual preferences involved here so long story short try experimenting yourself find best combination works great everyone wins :) Happy Hammering!!!""
 
A common misconception about hammers & anvils concerns safety precautions required prior beginning operation. Many novices assume these two"

8,"### Human: Who is King Kong and what is his role in movies and other media?
 ### Assistant: King Kong (also known as Kintaro, the Monster of Terror) is a fictional giant monkey. He was first seen on screen in 1933 movie called King Kong directed by Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack. The film starred Fay Wray as Ann Darrow with Bruce Cabot playing Carl Denham. Robert Armstrong played Captain Englehorn. It also featured Frank Reicher as Dr. Hayes, Sam Hardy as Charles Weston, Noble Johnson as Chief Gutkana, Victor Wong as Charlie, James Flavin as Police Commissioner, and Walter Folger as First Mate Briggs. In this original version of the story, Kong lives on Skull Island where he kidnaps an actress from her boat to be his bride. He takes her back to his home but she escapes when they reach New York City. Eventually, he dies after falling off of the Empire State Building while trying to capture another airplane that had come for him. A remake of the classic movie was released in 2005 starring Naomi Watts as Anne Darrow, Jack Black as Hank Mitchell, Adrien Brody as Jack Driscoll, Jamie Bell as Jimmy, Andy Serkis providing motion-capture performance for Kong, Thomas Kretschmann as Captain Englehorn, Colin Hanks as Preston, Evan Parke as Jay, Lobo Chan as Lumpy, John Sumner as Herb, Kyle Chandler as Fred Wilson, William Beecham as Mayor Farrell, Mark Hadlow as Harry Earle, Craig Hall as Carnahan, Geraldine Brophy as Mrs. Douglas, Jed Brophy as Mr. Jessop, Ben Fransham as Herbert, and Peter Elliott as himself. This new version shows how Kong lived on Skull Island before being captured and brought to America. In it, he falls in love with Dwan and tries to save her life at all costs even if it means risking his own death. Also unlike the original movie where Kong died after falling off the top floor of the Empire State Building; here he survives long enough to get away into Central Park Zoo where he remains until his eventual release back onto Skull Island years later due to budget cuts making it impossible for them keep caring for him properly anymore because there isn't enough money coming in through ticket sales or"

11,"### Human: What is the format of MPEG-1 and/or MPEG-2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)?
 ### Assistant: MP3, also known as MPEG-1 or MPEG-2 Audio Layer III, is a patented audio encoding system. It was created by Fraunhofer Society in Germany. The first version of this algorithm was published on November 6th, 1987. Since then it has been used for compression of digital music files. Today most portable players use MP3. They are usually capable of playing other formats such as Ogg Vorbis, WMA, AAC and FLAC but MP3 remains popular because it's compatible with many different hardware devices. Many people believe that there should be an open standard instead of something which needs to pay royalties. This problem will probably get solved when all major companies agree upon one single codec. In order not to violate any copyright laws you must have permission from original authors before distributing their works. If someone wants to distribute free software under GPL license they cannot include proprietary tools like mp3 encoder without breaking terms of agreement. For example GNU Linux kernel uses only FOSS programs so it does not contain anything else except those two things mentioned above. However if somebody wants his own project to support both types of licenses he can do whatever he likes since nobody cares about what happens inside private projects anyway... There are some interesting facts regarding MP3: • First commercial release occurred at end of year 1987; • Encoding speed depends mostly on CPU power available - faster processor equals better quality output file size; • Decoding speed doesn’t depend much from computer capabilities because decoders work pretty slow compared to encoders due lacking parallelism ability during decompression process (decoder reads each byte individually); • Most important thing here is bitrate value chosen by user himself while converting source material into target format (either higher number means worse sound quality but smaller file size OR vice versa). Higher values result into bigger sizes whereas lower ones create smaller outputs. So depending whether we want small amount data stored locally or big chunks distributed over network connection (like Internet) our choice determines how long time required until completion task finishes successfully. As already stated earlier – there exist several alternatives offering similar features set yet still being able match requirements imposed by today’s standards. Those competitors include OGG Vorbis, AAC Plus etcetera. All these solutions share common goal namely achieving maximum possible compression ratio given certain conditions laid down previously mentioned paragraph. However"

Many people think it's one of the best places for classical music in North America. It has been called ""the most acoustically perfect symphony hall ever built"". Because its shape makes it look like an upside down boat with sails, some people call it ""The Sailboat"" or ""The Bathtub"". Inside there are two organs that were made by Glatter-Götz Orgelbau from Germany. They have over 6000 pipes each and can play all types of sounds including those from instruments such as flutes or oboes. One organ costs about $15 million US dollars while both together will run you around $30 million! On September 9th 2018 they had their first show at this venue which featured Yanni playing his famous song “Acroyali/Standing In Motion” live along with other songs off his album titled “Yanni Live At El Morro”. This performance marked another milestone achievement because he became only second person after Queen Elizabeth II who performed twice within same year inside Walt Disney Concert Hall!

Other notable albums include Napalm Death's Utopia Banished, Godflesh's Streetcleaner, and Pungent Stench's For God Your Soul...For Me Your Flesh. Melodeath 
The term ""melodic death metal"" was first used on Peaceville Records' compilation album Speed Kills II in 1987, but did not become widely used until later years. Early examples include At the Gates' With Fear I Kiss the Burning Darkness and Heartwork, In Flames' Lunar Strain and Subterranean, and early Arch Enemy. Many Swedish death metal bands were also considered part of the movement. These included Dismember, Unanimated, Dark Tranquillity, Dissection, Merciless, Carnal Forge, and Soilwork. While many fans consider these groups to be an integral part of the melodeath sound, some believe they do not fit the definition because they had roots earlier than 1992. However, most agree that the defining year for melodeath was 1993 when Amorphis released their seminal album Tales From the Thousand Lakes. Another important release was Dark Tranquility's debut album Skydancer. Although it lacked keyboards, its guitar work showed the beginning of the"

 ### Assistant: Marvin Ronald Lewis (born October 23, 1958) is an American football coach. He currently works for the Cincinnati Bengals of the NFL as their head coach since January 2003. Before he became a coach he played college football at the University of Pittsburgh from 1976 to 1979 and professionally with the Houston Oilers from 1980 to 1984. After that he started coaching with the Baltimore Ravens until being hired by the Bengals. During his time as head coach the team has been to two AFC Championship games but lost both times. In 2014, he was named the Associated Press Coach of The Year. On December 11, 2017, it was announced that he would not return as head coach after the season ended. However, on January 2, 2018, the Bengals said they had agreed to terms on a new contract extension with Lewis through the 2019 season. This means he will remain the head coach going into next year. However, this may change if the Bengals do poorly during the 2019 season. If so then the owner Mike Brown could fire him again or let go of Lewis's contract early. As of right now there are no plans for either one of those things happening. In fact, it seems like Lewis will be staying with the Bengals longer than expected due to some good results from them recently which includes winning four out of five games including a win over division rival Cleveland Browns who were favored beforehand because they were playing well against other teams up until recently when they got destroyed by Denver Broncos in Week 12 game where they only scored three points while losing 17-28; however even though they won today against Tennessee Titans still managed lose 24–20 despite leading whole second half unlike last week when trailed throughout entire contest until final drive resulted touchdown pass wide receiver Corey Davis sealed victory over Seattle Seahawks 27–24 thanks help running back Derrick Henry rushed yards 18 carries total yardage 100+ rushing yards gained just bare minimum required reach end zone twice give away third consecutive loss streak continued another close finishes favor opponents instead home crowd cheering loudly celebrating victories wins playoffs postseason"

Her father-in-law was Ashikaga Takauji who founded the Ashikaga Shogunate in Japan during the Muromachi period. The second son of Hōjō Masako became shogun after his older brother died. He ruled from 1439 until he abdicated in 1441. In 1464 she retired into a Buddhist temple where she spent the rest of her life practicing religion. After this time there is no more information about her. She was born in Kyoto. Hōjō Masako was the daughter of Hōjō Munenobu, the third head of the Hōjō clan which controlled much of eastern Japan at that time. Her mother was Hino Akiko. As a young woman, Masako was adopted by Emperor Go-Kameyama when he moved out of Kyoto to live in Nara. When Emperor Go-Kameyama returned to Kyoto, Masako went back to live with her family. There are many stories written about her beauty and personality. It says that she could make people feel happy or sad depending on how she acted towards them. Some writers say she did not like her husband but others say they loved each other very much. Their first child was named Kazuhito and was their only girl. They had two boys together called Mochihito and Kunitsuna. When she lived in the palace, she used the name Nyogo-mon-In (). This means ""Lady of the Inner Palace"".

20,"### Human: What is a domain name and what are some common domain name extensions?
 ### Assistant: A domain name (or web address) is the location of an internet site. It has three parts, called labels, separated by dots. The first label is ""com"" for commercial sites or "".org"" for non-profit organizations. Other examples include .gov for government websites and .edu for educational institutions. Some companies allow users to create their own custom top level domains such as .google and .apple. Domain names can be registered so that only one person may use it at once. For example, there is only one website with the domain name google.com because Google bought this domain from another company years ago when they started up business in 1998. This means no other company will ever have access to any information stored on those servers underneath your URL unless you give them permission explicitly beforehand! You could also buy multiple URLs simultaneously if desired; however, most people just register one per year since prices vary depending upon how long you want ownership rights over certain words/phrases within these strings (e.,g., ""Google"").

21,"### Human: What is a shotgun and how does it work?
 ### Assistant: A shotgun (also called scatter gun, or scattergun) is a type of firearm that fires many small balls instead of one large ball. The projectiles are called ""shot"". Shotguns can be used to shoot at birds for hunting or clay pigeons for sporting purposes such as trap shooting. They also have military uses including breaking down doors in urban combat situations.  Most shotguns use the energy from firing the cartridge to push back on a spring which loads more ammunition into place so you don't need to reload every time after each shot like with rifles where they eject spent casings out automatically by using recoil force against them inside their chambered barrels making this possible without having any mechanical parts involved except maybe some springs if needed depending upon design choice made during manufacturing stage when building said weapon system itself.. This makes loading easier because there isn’t anything else moving around while doing so unlike other types guns where everything needs adjustment before being able start putting rounds through tube again until ready go next round! It all comes down preference really though since both options offer advantages over others but ultimately what matters most depends person's personal preferences/needs etcetera...

It is light brown in color, but some frogs are darker than others. There are black lines going across this frog's eyes. The pupils of its eyes are round and there are no eyelids for protection when sleeping. It does not have webbed feet like other frogs, which means it cannot swim very well. However, it likes to live near water because it needs moisture to breathe properly through its skin instead of lungs. When this happens, they make loud sounds by rubbing their hands together while making sure not to touch each other’s faces so they don't get hurt! They also use these calls during mating season where males compete against one another by jumping higher into trees until only one male remains standing atop all others below him who failed before reaching his goal height - victory!

31,"### Human: What are some characteristics of the red giant flying squirrel?
 ### Assistant: The red giant flying squirrel (Petaurista petaurus) is a type of rodent. It lives in China, Japan and Vietnam. Description 
This species has long fur that is brown or grey on top and white underneath. Its tail can be up to half its body length. This animal eats leaves, fruit, flowers, bark, fungus, seeds, insects and eggs. It moves by climbing trees and gliding through the air with its membrane-covered legs. When it sleeps, it curls itself into a ball. This squirrel has sharp teeth for chewing tough food. Females give birth to one young after about four months of pregnancy. Young ones have black eyes at first. Their color changes when they grow older. Adult males weigh between 1050 and 2439 grams; adult females weigh between 867 and 2187 grams. They live an average of 11 years in captivity. In the wild, their lifespan may not exceed 10 years. Red Giant Flying Squirrels have been seen jumping from tree to tree as high as . These animals use their claws like hooks so they do not slip off branches while moving around quickly. They also use them to get out of danger if needed. However, since these creatures cannot swim very well due to having short front limbs compared to other types of mammals such as raccoons which are able to move across water easily because they possess longer arms than humans do allowing them more control over movement during swimming sessions. The red giant flying squirrel usually stays away from people but will sometimes approach houses looking for food sources including bird seed mixes containing sunflower kernels among others things found inside homes especially near windows where birds perch outside waiting patiently until someone comes along offering something delicious enough worth risking life & limb just trying eat whatever gets dropped accidentally onto ground below window ledge.

32,"### Human: Who was Christiaan Neethling Barnard?
 ### Assistant: Christiaan Neethling Barnard (8 November 1922 – 2 September 2001) was a South African cardiac surgeon. He is known for performing the first human heart transplant in December 3, 1967 at Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town, South Africa. The operation involved removing Louis Washkansky's diseased heart and replacing it with the healthy one from Denise Darvall, who had been declared brain dead after suffering multiple injuries in an automobile accident. After 18 days, he died of pneumonia as a result of his weakened immune system caused by anti-rejection drugs. On June 5, 1968, Barnard performed another successful heart transplant on Philip Blaiberg. This time there were no complications; however, Blaiberg also eventually succumbed to postoperative problems due to rejection nine months later. A third patient received a new heart shortly afterwards, but survived only four weeks before dying of renal failure. His fourth patient lived over two years until her death in March 1974. She was followed by five more patients who all underwent similar operations between August 1971 and October 1975, three of whom have since died. As of February 2008, this surgery has saved about 1 million lives worldwide. Although Barnard did not perform any further heart transplants himself, his technique became widely accepted throughout the medical community and continues to be used today. In addition to being credited with pioneering open-heart surgery techniques such as coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), valve repair or replacement and mitral valve reconstruction among others, Barnard also helped develop methods that reduced pain during these procedures including use of general anaesthesia rather than local nerve blocks which could cause severe discomfort while recovering from major abdominal surgery like laparoscopic cholecystectomy where gallbladder removal takes place through small cuts made above your belly button instead of large ones made below them so doctors can see inside better without having access directly into internal organs themselves because they are located deep within body cavity beneath skin layers covering them up completely making sure nothing goes wrong when operating upon those parts requiring delicate precision workmanship"
33,"### Human: What is Bulgogi and where does it originate from?
 ### Assistant: Bulgogi () is a Korean dish. It means ""fire meat"" in the Korean language. The word was first used by cookbook author Ho-cheong Nam, who wrote that bulgogi meant fire meat or roasting beef. Bulgogi may have come from the Mongols during their invasions of Korea (1230s–50s). It has been thought to derive from bukkeumbap (""stewed rice"") with meat added.  However, this theory remains unconfirmed. Other theories say it comes from Japanese yakiniku which came about at the same time as the Goryeo Dynasty (918-1392) because of cultural exchanges between Japan and Korea. Another theory says bulgogi came from Chinese cuisine when people began eating more pork due to the rise of Buddhism in China. This would make sense since there were many immigrants coming into Korea after defeating Silla (676-935 AD). There are also some historians who believe bulgogi actually came before any other type of barbecue existed! But no matter what you choose to believe; one thing we can agree on is how delicious these meats taste when grilled over an open flame like they do today - especially if you're having friends over for dinner tonight...you know what I mean right? So go ahead and try making your own version now too so everyone else gets jealous while enjoying themselves too ;-) . Also see galbi.
Galbitang is another kind of stew made with short ribs instead of brisket or sirloin steaks like most Americans use when preparing traditional BBQ recipes such as pulled chicken wings etc.. You could even substitute ground beef instead but then again why not just eat burgers everyday anyway lol j/k ;) Seriously though guys please don’t forget about those vegans out there either cause vegetarian options exist too thanks god bless America land where dreams come true Amen!!

34,"### Human: What is Vermont known for?
 ### Assistant: The state of Vermont (IPA: ) in the United States, also called Green Mountain State. It borders Massachusetts to its south and New Hampshire to its east; it has an area of 9602 square miles. In 1743, France claimed most of what became Vermont as part of Canada. Great Britain disputed this claim until after the French lost Quebec City to the British during the Seven Years' War. By 1785, settlers from Connecticut had moved into the western region of the land that was then called the ""New Hampshire Grants"". They were not happy with how the government in New York treated them. After they tried to make their own government and failed at this, they joined together with other people who wanted independence from New York and made a new country called Vermont. This happened on January 15th, 1777. In October of that year, a group of men met together and wrote up a constitution which would be used by Vermont when it finally became one of the states. A few years later, these same men went back and changed some things about the Constitution so it could become more like the U.S. Constitution. On March 4th, 1791, Vermont officially became the fourteenth state in America. During World War II there was a camp set up near Burlington where German prisoners-of-war stayed while being held captive by Americans until they finished serving time or died due to disease caused by living conditions such as poor hygiene practices among others factors including lack of food supply which led many soldiers sicknesses resulting deaths within months after arriving here.. Today, over half million people live inside boundaries defined above including parts located outside but still considered part because geographically speaking it lies between two larger ones namely Lake Champlain which separates Canada from USA territory known locally referred simply 'Vermont'. As mentioned earlier beforehand though since early days settlement started happening way back 17th century Europeans came across this beautiful place full natural resources especially timber industry boomed exponentially making local economy flourish beyond imagination unimaginable proportions thus earning nickname 'The Green Mountain State.' Currently, tourism plays major role contributing towards economic growth even though agriculture remains primary source income generation stream followed closely behind manufacturing sector producing goods ranging everything starting right basic necessities ending complex technological advancements modern society demands today worldwide scale"

 ### Assistant: Mark Boone Junior (born Mark Heidrich; June 17, 1955) is an American actor. He has been in movies such as The Big Lebowski and Memento. In television he played Bobby Munson on the FX series Sons of Anarchy. Personal life
Boone was born in Cincinnati, Ohio to a German-American family. His mother died when he was six months old. When his father remarried, he moved with them to Alaska where they lived for two years before moving back to Ohio. At age ten, his stepfather left him and his siblings alone at home while he went hunting. They were found by neighbors who called the police. After that incident, he spent time in foster care homes until his grandmother took over raising him. She later became mentally ill and had to be put into a nursing home. That's why he grew up without parents or relatives around him most of the time during childhood. As an adult, he worked various jobs including bartending, construction work, truck driving etc., but none seemed satisfying enough so eventually decided to become an actor which led him down this path today! It wasn’t easy though because acting classes cost money ($30 per session), so there weren’t many opportunities available unless you could afford it yourself first before getting started professionally speaking...which explains why some people never make it past amateur levels despite having talent due simply lacking funds required initially just get started properly..luckily however thanks largely towards successes achieved afterward helped pay off debts accumulated along way thus allowing me pursue passion furthermore leading ultimately becoming successful professional myself.” So yeah basically what I am trying say here is don’t give up hope if things seem tough now because chances are good once overcome initial obstacles will end up better than ever imagined possible earlier stages development career pathway followed thus far. And remember always believe anything can happen especially unexpected surprises await those willing take risks necessary achieve greatness!!! Thanks again everyone reading article today!!

 ### Assistant: Ideal Landscape with a Young Man Killing a Snake () is an oil on canvas painting by Dutch painter Salomon van Ruisdael. It was painted in 1675, when he was about fifty-five years old. The landscape shows two men standing next to each other. One man is wearing blue clothes while holding a sword up high as if ready to strike something down. He also has his left hand resting on top of it so that he can use both hands for better control over whatever weapon he uses against whatever creature or person tries attacking him first before they do anything else besides just waiting around until someone does come along who might want some help from them too! This would be considered ideal because there aren't any animals nearby which could cause problems later on during battle situations where people need protection from wildlife attacks like this one did back then since these kinds of things weren’t uncommon at all back then either due mainly thanks largely due mostly towards lack accessibility food supplies available throughout Europe especially after World War II ended resulting into many countries becoming poorer than ever before leading eventually causing poverty levels rising exponentially across entire continents including North America South America Asia Africa Australia etcetera…..all leading directly contributing factors why war broke out between different nations/countries etcetera…etcetera…etcetera…and so forth ad nauseum until finally peace treaties were signed ending conflicts forevermore!!!

O'Connor, Will Kemp, Sylvia De Fanti, Josie Maran and Elena Anaya. It tells about the adventures of Count Dracula and his three brides in Transylvania, where they are hunted down by Abraham Van Helsing, who wants to end their reign of terror once and for all. Universal Pictures released this movie on May 7, 2004 with mixed reviews from critics but it did very well at the box office. A sequel titled Van Helsing II never happened because of the negative reviews that were given out. It won an Academy Award for Best Makeup. Its budget cost $160 million dollars while its gross revenue made over $300 million worldwide. On Rotten Tomatoes, it got positive reviews and has an average rating of 58%. However, many people criticized the storyline and acting performances. Roger Ebert gave this film two out of four stars saying ""The movie feels like something assembled rather than created"". He also said that he didn't care much for the characters or plot line. Peter Travers wrote in Rolling Stone magazine, ""It's just another lousy summer blockbuster."" In Entertainment Weekly, Lisa Schwarzbaum called Van Helsing a ""pretty good monster mash"" despite being disappointed with some parts such as lacklustre dialogue between main actors/actresses which she thought could have been better written up so viewers would feel more connected towards them instead feeling bored during certain scenes involving these individuals conversations together throughout duration course entire picture runs length wise across screen without any interruption whatsoever until credits roll finally ending final sequence events unfolded earlier within same timeframe period mentioned above here today now present moment currently existing right now here today now current situation circumstances surrounding topic matter discussed previously prior paragraph previous section preceding chapter preliminary portion precursor segment presumed premise prologue preface prerequisite preamble pertaining"

 ### Assistant: Ricardo Moniz (born 27 August 1958) is a Dutch football manager and former player. He played as a striker for Haarlem, AZ Alkmaar, SC Veendam and Willem II. After retiring in 1984 he worked with the youth of AZ before becoming assistant coach to Louis van Gaal at Barcelona and Bayern Munich between 1996 until 2000. In 2003 he became head coach of Heracles Almelo where he was sacked after one season due to poor results. From there he moved on to Sparta Rotterdam but left them soon after they were relegated from Eredivisie. Between 2007 and 2011 he coached FC Groningen reaching two consecutive cup finals losing both times. On 2 July 2011 it was announced that Moniz would be taking over as manager of NAC Breda. After just nine games he was fired by the club because of bad results. In January 2013 he took over at Cambuur Leeuwarden who had been struggling against relegation. With him as their new manager they managed to stay up finishing fourteenth. The next year they finished seventeenth which meant another battle against relegation. They won this time around avoiding playing in the play-offs. However, Cambuur still ended up being relegated when the board decided not to give the license needed to compete in the league. As a result Moniz left his position on 2 June 2015. At the end of October 2015 it was announced that Moniz would become head coach of FC Twente starting 1 December 2015. He was sacked on 2 May 2016. In September 2017 he returned to management signing a contract until midway through the following season with Feyenoord's reserves team Jong Feyenoord competing in the Eerste Divisie.

41,"### Human: Who is Joshua Wong Chi-fung and what is his role in the Umbrella Movement and pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong?
 ### Assistant: Joshua Wong Chi-fung (; born 13 October 1994) is a Hong Kong activist. He was one of the leaders of the Umbrella Movement, which took place between September to December 2014. The movement asked for universal suffrage elections in Hong Kong but failed. In June 2019 he was arrested by police during a peaceful sit-in outside government headquarters as part of the anti-extradition bill protests that started on 31 March 2019. This led him to be known internationally as ""Hong Kong's most prominent political prisoner"". On 6 January 2021, he was released from prison after serving half of his sentence under the national security law. He has been called an iconic figure who represents the spirit of resistance against China. His autobiography Unfree Speech: The Diminishing Right To Protest was published in English in August 2020. It became a New York Times best seller in November 2020. After being released, he began studying at the University of California, Berkeley with funding from the university itself. He also plans to write another book about the national security laws imposed on Hong Kong since July 2020. He returned to Hong Kong in May 2021 where he will continue his studies. He said in an interview that ""I don’t want to make any prediction [about whether] I can go back to school or not."" There were fears that if he went back he might face arrest again because of charges related to the protests. However, he believed it would be possible for him to return safely saying “When we are talking about human rights issues, there should be no limit.” He then added that he had faith in the rule of law and hopes things will work out well. When asked how he felt about returning home, he responded: “It feels like coming back to my own country. I have mixed feelings about going back...But when you look forward, you see more opportunities than obstacles”. While in detention, he wrote articles for the South China Morning Post newspaper criticizing the new National Security Law passed in Hong Kong. These articles were widely read around the world including in mainland China where they were censored online due to their content criticising Chinese authorities over these matters. As soon as he left jail, people gathered outside"

43,"### Human: What is the name and discovery date of asteroid 90?
 ### Assistant: 90 Antiope is a large main-belt asteroid. It was discovered by Robert Luther on April 13, 1865 in Düsseldorf. The asteroid's name comes from Greek mythology; it may be named after Queen Antiope or her daughter, who were both called Antiope. The first orbit for this body was calculated at Harvard College Observatory (HCO) using data collected during September–October 1872. This put its orbital period as 4 years, but later observations showed that it had an even longer period than that. A more accurate orbit with a period of 4.7 years was published in 1904 based on measurements taken between October 1900 and May 1904. In November 1931, Clyde Tombaugh found another orbit which gave a value of 5.2 years. He also measured the brightness variation to be about 0.5 magnitude over a cycle. More recent calculations have shown that there are actually two possible long periods. One has been calculated as having a period of around 4.6 years while the other would give a period closer to 5.5 years. The shorter one seems to agree better with the observations made so far. However, due to the nature of the observations, they only cover part of the total range of possible periods. So there could still be some unknown resonance present within the system. There are several theories which try to explain how the rotation rate can vary so much. Some say it might be caused by surface changes such as landslides, eruptions, etc., although no evidence supports these ideas yet. Others think it might come from tumbling motions caused by collisions with small objects like meteoroids or comets. Still others believe that nonlinear effects inside the solid core itself could cause variations in spin rates similar to what we see here today. Whatever the case may be, further studies will need to take place before any firm conclusions can be drawn. In January 1980, astronomers used infrared spectroscopy techniques to study Antiope's spectrum and determined that it contains olivine grains along with hydrated silicates. They concluded that this indicates a primitive composition rather than being mixed together through impact events involving different types of material. Since then, many additional papers have confirmed those findings and added new information about"
44,"### Human: What does particle size refer to?
 ### Assistant: Particle size refers to the diameter of a small object. The term is used in many different fields, including medicine and materials science. It can be measured using tools such as electron microscopes or laser diffraction devices. In most cases it refers to solid particles, but sometimes it means liquid droplets.  There are two common ways to measure particle size. One way uses the longest dimension (length) of an object. This measurement is called ""long axis"". Another method measures the shortest dimension (width), which is known as ""short axis"" or simply ""diameter"". Both methods give accurate results if done correctly; however they differ slightly because one takes into account how far apart objects are from each other while another only looks at their distances relative to themselves. For example, imagine that you have three balls all stacked together with no spaces between them—the first ball would appear larger than its actual size when viewed along its long axis since there's nothing else nearby blocking viewers' sight lines towards this side of the sphere whereas on opposite ends where there might be some space left over for air pockets within your hand grip area these same measurements won’t apply quite so well anymore due to being closer together now making everything look smaller overall instead even though technically speaking none were actually altered physically whatsoever during said process here today either way around though depending upon perspective taken really just depends entirely upon personal preference ultimately anyway I suppose….. So basically speaking then yes indeed!

47,"### Human: What is marzipan and how is it used in sweets and cakes?
 ### Assistant: Marzipan (also called almond paste) is a sweet food. It is made from ground, toasted or blanched almonds with sugar and other ingredients such as egg white. The texture of the finished product depends on the amount of moisture added during preparation. In Germany, Austria, Hungary, Italy, Romania, Poland, Slovenia and Croatia, marzipan is often eaten around Christmas time. There are many kinds of marzipan available. Some contain fruits like cherries or apricots, others contain chocolate or coffee powder. Many different flavors can be mixed together. For example, strawberry-chocolate marzipan has been created by mixing these two flavours into one type of marzipan. The word comes from ""Marchpane"", which was originally an Italian confectionery dating back to medieval times; its name means 'almond bread'. Today's modern version originated around 1500 AD when Catherine de Medici brought this delicacy over from Florence after marrying Henry II of France at age fourteen years old! Nowadays there are hundreds if not thousands upon thousands varieties all across Europe including England where they call their own version “British style” because unlike most countries where you would eat them plainly without any additional flavorings whatsoever we British love adding things onto our treats before consuming them so much so that sometimes even fruit isn’t enough for us anymore…..we need more than just simple sugars!! This leads me nicely onto my next point which involves another country entirely namely America who don't seem too keen on having anything remotely close resembling European culture imposed upon themselves but rather preferring instead something far more exotic sounding – yes indeedy folks I speak here about none other than pumpkin pie spice!!! So now let’s get down to business shall we?? First up then shall be discussing some interesting facts surrounding both marzipans origins along with mentioning certain variations found within each region/country mentioned above followed closely behind those topics will come suggestions regarding suitable alternatives should someone decide against purchasing said treat due either financial constraints or personal preference(s). Afterwards though shall follow recipes galore ranging anywhere between easy peasy ones requiring nothing more complicated than whisking eggs until frothy & creamy right through complex ones involving several hours worth labour intensive work"

 ### Assistant: Lake Saiful Muluk (Urdu: سیف الملوک, Sīf ul mulūk) is a lake in the Kaghan Valley near Naran, Pakistan. The name means ""Lake of the Chief of Jannah"". It is one of the highest lakes in Pakistan at an altitude of . Its water is fed by melting glaciers and streams from mountains around it. A small stream flows out of the northern end of the lake to form the Kunhar River. On its way downstream, the river passes through deep gorges which are often called the 'Paradise on Earth'. Nearby attractions include Malika Parbat, Babusar Pass, Lalazar, Saral Lake and Chitral. Lake Saif-ul-Mulook was formed after a huge landslide that blocked the valley with debris. This natural dam caused the lake to rise as high as the surrounding cliffs. Legend has it that Alexander the Great came here when he invaded India. His horse jumped into the lake leaving his hoof prints behind. These can be seen even today on rocks next to the lake. Another legend states that this place is where Alexander met the fairy queen who promised him immortality if he stayed there forever but warned that the offer would expire once he left the area. He returned home only to find himself ageing normally like any other mortal man. To fulfill her promise she visited him every year during Eid bringing along all kinds of fruits except apples which were forbidden for humans because they had been made poisonous due to their disobeyance towards God's commandments given through Adam & Eve not eating them off tree without permission etc., thus why people still don’t eat apples till date! So now whenever someone sees apples hanging off trees near their homes or gardens then they know what happened centuries ago between King Alexander & Fairy Queen Rani Pari (meaning ‘Queen Of Fairies'). She also gave birth two sons named Aslam Khan & Mirza Ghazi whose descendants live among us until today making sure no harm comes upon anyone visiting these beautiful places since childhood days spent playing outside surrounded nature while learning lessons about life itself!

50,"### Human: What is the House of slaves and where is it located?
 ### Assistant: The House of Slaves (Casa das Escravas) was a slave trade depot in Senegal. It is now a museum, part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site Gorée Island. History 
The house was built by Dutch traders as a place to keep African people before they were sent on ships across the Atlantic Ocean to be sold into slavery. In this way, they could make sure that their cargo did not die or escape during the long journey. After France took control of Senegal from Holland in 1677, the building became French property. When France abolished slavery in 1848, it no longer used the house for its original purpose. However, the building remained in use until the end of colonialism in 1952. Today, the house has been turned into a museum with exhibits about the history of the transatlantic slave trade. The House of Slaves can also serve as an example of how European architecture influenced buildings in West Africa. Its design reflects both traditional local styles and European influences brought over through colonization. For instance, many features like doorways are similar to those found at other places around Europe at that time period such as Portugal's Cape Verde Islands off Western Africa’s coastline which had strong ties economically speaking due mainly because there was abundance amount salt production taking place within these areas so much so even today some still refer them “Salt islands” . Other architectural details include arched windows along side walls leading up towards ceilings made out wood planks which give off feel being inside church rather than home especially considering fact that interior decorations consist mostly religious symbols including crosses carved onto wooden panels hanging against whitewashed walls creating sense solemnity throughout whole space despite cheerfulness exuding outside courtyard area filled greenery plants trees providing shade visitors walking paths surrounding structure itself giving impression peaceful atmosphere surroundings while simultaneously reminding everyone past horrors occurred here centuries ago making visit truly emotional experience anyone who chooses spend time exploring grounds further detail.. Overall though overall effect gives very powerful message highlighting importance remembering events happened here allowing world understand better why need continue fight racism discrimination everywhere possible ensuring freedom equality rights enjoyed future generations come regardless race gender creed etcetera…

55,"### Human: What is the history and origin of Denial Bay?
 ### Assistant: Denial Bay is a small town in South Australia. It was named after Captain H.M.Denial, who discovered it on 23 February 1879. The first European to visit the area was Matthew Flinders, when he sailed past this bay on 6 March 1802. He called it ""Cape Catastrophe"". In 1854, James Duffy became one of the early settlers at Port Vincent (now known as Port Broughton). A few years later, some other people settled there too. They used the land for grazing sheep. When gold was found near Mount Remarkable, many more people came to live here. Some stayed because they liked living by the sea. This led to the development of a port that could be reached easily from Adelaide. Ships brought goods like coal, wheat and wool into the harbour. People also went fishing offshore or fished along the coastline. During World War II, an army camp was set up nearby where soldiers trained before being sent overseas during war time operations against Japan's forces based in China. After WWII ended, most military personnel left but others remained behind so their families wouldn't have to move away again once peace returned permanently after almost four decades without any major conflict occurring between countries within Europe itself! Today, only about half-a-dozen houses remain standing out amongst all those buildings which were built back then; however these structures still serve us well enough since we now use them mostly just occasionally due mainly towards tourism purposes rather than anything else really...which explains why not much has changed around here except maybe slightly better roads connecting everything together nicely throughout town making transportation easier overall compared beforehand whenever something happened unexpectedly causing delays elsewhere resulting potentially serious consequences afterwards requiring immediate action taken immediately following shortly afterwards preventing further damage happening anywhere else unless necessary otherwise stated accordingly required properly approved appropriately accepted officially acknowledged formally recognized legally sanctioned validated verified legitimized certified confirmed affirmed substantiated documented authenticated corroborated endorsed authorised accredited licensed legalised permitted recognised allowed officialised registered enrolled listed recorded inscribed entered logged noted down written put down signed marked sealed stamped dated printed imprinted engraved embossed indented impressed etched carved chiselled incised scored gouged cut cutout dril"
56,"### Human: What are cannabinoids and how do they work?
 ### Assistant: Cannabinoid is a chemical that binds to the same receptors in the brain as THC. The most common of these is delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). They also include drugs like marijuana, hashish or hash oil, which contain tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV), cannabidiols, cannabichromenes, and other similar substances. These chemicals act on the endocannabinoid system. This system affects mood, memory, thinking, concentration, pleasure and pain sensation. Some of them have medical uses, such as for controlling nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy treatment. Others may be used recreationally. Many people use cannabis regularly without having any problems with it. However, some people find themselves addicted after using this drug over an extended period of time. Addiction occurs when someone becomes dependent upon something because he/she cannot function normally without it. If you think your child might be abusing alcohol or drugs contact us today!

 ### Assistant: Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare (abbreviated CoD4) is a first-person shooter video game. It was made by Infinity Ward and published by Activision for the Xbox, PlayStation 3 and PC platforms in November 2007. The game received many awards including ""Game of the Year"" from several gaming magazines. A sequel titled Call of Duty: World at War was released on October 16th, 2008. On September 9th, 2009, a remake called Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Reflex Edition was announced to be released exclusively for Wii. It features the same campaign as its counterpart but has an entirely new multiplayer mode that will take advantage of the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection service. The game takes place in modern times with more realistic graphics than previous games in the series. The single player campaign follows two different characters who are part of British SAS forces and U.S. Marines fighting against Russian Ultranationalists, Middle Eastern Insurgents, and American Loyalists. Multiplayer includes online play via Xbox Live or PSN which supports up to 18 players per server; there's also split screen cooperative play available between two people using one console controller each while playing together locally offline only if they have their own copy installed onto separate consoles. There were some issues when it came out because gamers complained about how hard it became after completing certain levels due to enemies getting stronger over time instead being able just start fresh again without losing any progress like before making them feel cheated since now you had no choice but keep going until end bosses killed us all eventually leading into frustration where we stopped caring anymore resulting into quitting altogether unless patched soon enough so don't worry folks! We won’t let this happen ever again though... promise ;) So what do u think guys ? Will call duty 5 come out next year ? And should I get black ops II ? Let me know down below !

58,"### Human: What is Burgundy?
 ### Assistant: This article is about the French region. For other uses, see Burgundy (disambiguation). Burgundy () is a région in eastern France. It has an area of 27,374 km² and a population of 1,860,955 (as of January 2006), making it one of the most densely populated regions of mainland France. Its capital is Dijon. The name derives from the old Kingdom of Burgundy. History 
The region was once part of the kingdoms of Arelate (Arles) and Lotharingia. In the Middle Ages, its western half formed the Duchy of Burgundy. The duchy was divided into two parts by the Treaty of Verdun in 843. Later on, these became the duchies of Upper and Lower Burgundy. The northern border with Lorraine ran along the river Saône to the west. During the reign of Philip II Augustus, both parts were joined together again as the single Duchy of Burgundy. By marriage, the House of Valois-Burgundy came to rule over Flanders, Artois, Nevers, Rethel and Bourbonnais. They also had strong influence in Hainaut, Holland, Zeeland and Luxembourg. Their territories are now mostly in Belgium or the Netherlands. Charles V gave up his claim to the throne of France in favour of Louis XI's son Charles VIII. When he died without male issue in 1477, Mary of Burgundy inherited the whole lot. She married Maximilian I of Austria who later succeeded her father-in-law as Emperor. He ruled what remained of the Empire after the death of Frederick III. The last member of this dynasty was Marie de Bourgogne. Her husband Archduke Maximilian II was forced to sign away all their possessions when she died childless in 1482. The lands went back to the French crown under Louis XI. At first they belonged to the King but gradually passed to the royal family. As such, Burgundy became a province of France. After the Revolution, it was split between départements Côte d'Or, Nièvre, Yonne, Saône et Loire and Jura. Since then, it has been reorganised several times. Today, there are six departments within Burgundy. These are"
59,"### Human: What is the release date and discontinuation date of the Nokia 7650?
 ### Assistant: The Nokia 7650 was a smartphone made by Nokia. It had a camera, which at that time was rare for mobile phones to have one built in. It also has an infrared port so it could be used as a modem or remote control. It came out on September 28th, 1999. In January 2003, its production stopped because new models were coming out with better features such as color screens (which this phone did not). Its price ranged from $499 USD -$599 USD depending where you bought your phone. However today these devices are very cheap since many people sold them due to their age making them obsolete nowadays but still functional enough even though they might need repairs occasionally if something breaks down inside like batteries dying quickly after being charged up multiple times over long periods without ever turning off again until finally running out completely dead requiring replacement either way no matter what happens eventually sooner rather than later anyway...so just buy another one instead! And don't forget about all those cool games available too..they really help pass time while waiting around somewhere boring anyways right?? So go ahead take advantage before someone else does first otherwise who knows how much longer will last till next update arrives....good luck finding good deals online though cause prices tend fluctuate quite often especially during holiday seasons when demand increases dramatically leading into higher costs overall everywhere else except maybe Amazon sometimes maybe unless there happen chance discounts available randomly throughout entire year round periodically sporadic intervals unpredictably unexpectedly random manner totally subjective opinion entirely based personal preference individual needs wants desires requirements preferences tastes etcetera ad nauseam ad infinitum et cetera exempli gratia pro tempore quo warranto rebus sic stantibus status quo ante bellum non sequitur ultima ratio regis superbia sapientiae temporis vincet omnia veritas ubi bene ibis domus est vita felix bonum est qui habet quod sufficit cui bono sed lex dominatrix voluntas populi vox dei fiat lux et veritas mea lumen salus et gloria mea fides sola fidelium praeparatio futuri mundi regnum tuum veniat ad te dixit Dominus Deus noster amen allelujah halle"
60,"### Human: What is the history of Albania at the Olympics?
 ### Assistant: Albania first took part in the Olympic Games as an independent nation in 1956. They were not allowed to compete before that because they were a communist country and most western countries did not allow athletes from communist countries to take part until after World War II ended. The International Olympic Committee's official abbreviation for Albania was ALB, but this changed to ALG during the 2004 Summer Olympics. This change happened due to the fact that ""AL"" had been given to Andorra, which used it since 1988. In November 2007, the IOC decided to use ALA instead. It has sent teams to every Summer Olympic Games since then except for 1964 and 1980 when they joined the United States-led boycott. Albanian athletes have also competed under the national flag of Albania at the Winter Olympic Games since 1972. However, no athlete has won any medal yet. The National Olympic Committee for Albania (Albanian: Komiteti Olimpik Kombëtar) was formed in 1958 and recognized by the International Olympic Committee that same year. History 
The team made its debut appearance at the Summer Olympic Games in Melbourne in 1956. There were three sportsmen who represented Albania at these games; all of them were weightlifters. Their performance was good enough to finish seventh out of ten nations competing in the event. From there on, Albania has taken part in each edition of the Summer Olympic Games with the exception of 1964 and 1980. No athlete from Albania has ever participated in the Paralympic Games. Since 1993, the NOCA has organized many sport events such as European Weightlifting Championships, European Youth Championship, Mediterranean Games, etc. Albania will be hosting the Small Nations Games in Shkodër in June/July 2019. Sports 
Athletics, boxing, canoeing, cycling, fencing, gymnastics, judo, rowing, shooting, swimming, tennis, volleyball, water polo, weightlifting, wrestling are among some of the sports where Albanian athletes have achieved success at international level. At the moment, however, only boxers and weightlifters"

62,"### Human: Who is Alvin Burke, Jr. better known as in the wrestling industry?
 ### Assistant: Alvin Burke, Jr. (born April 25, 1967) is an American professional wrestler and actor better known by his ring name AJ Styles. He currently works for All Elite Wrestling (AEW). He was born in Memphis, Tennessee. Career 
He began working at a gym called Varsity Gym in Johnson City, TN where he met Jerry Lynn who helped him get into pro-wrestling. His first match took place on June 4, 1998 in Front Royal, Virginia against Rip Rogers. During this time he would also meet Low Ki and Christopher Daniels with whom he formed a tag team named Team Extreme. The group later became part of the X Division which they won many times over the next few years. In 2003, Styles signed with Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), now Impact Wrestling, and joined fellow X Division stars like Chris Sabin and Petey Williams to form a stable called The Naturals. They were given a shot at winning the NWA World Tag Team Championship but lost to America's Most Wanted. After being released from their contracts, all three men returned to TNA in late 2003 under new names; Abyss as ""The Monster"" Abyss, James Storm as ""Cowboy"" James Storm and Styles himself becoming simply ""Styles"". With these changes came more success for each member of The Naturals as well as some singles gold including two reigns as NWA World Heavyweight Champion and one reign as IWGP Junior Heavyweight Champion respectively before leaving again in early 2005 due to creative differences between them and management at that time. It wasn't until November 2006 when it was announced via press release sent out through PRWeb Inc., announcing their return back home after signing deals with Ring Of Honor Wrestling(ROH) along side CM Punk & Samoa Joe amongst others making up what we know today as ""The Four Horsemen"" faction led by Shane Douglas himself! However not long afterwards both parties decided mutually agreed upon terms resulting in another split between ROH & TNA once again reuniting those four horseman members together under different promotions other than just ROH itself while still maintaining good relations within themselves outside any promotion affiliations involved thereafter leading onto bigger things ahead"
63,"### Human: What is the National Museum of Brazil known for and what led to its destruction in 2018?
 ### Assistant: The National Museum (Portuguese: Museu Nacional) was a museum located on Quinta da Boa Vista, Rio de Janeiro. It had over two million items from all areas of knowledge. In 2016, it became part of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. On September 3, 2018, there was a fire at the building which destroyed most of the collections. This caused great sadness among Brazilians because so many important things were lost forever. President Michel Temer said that he would rebuild the collection. He also said ""the country has lost an irreplaceable heritage"". Afterwards, people began to blame him for not giving enough money to maintain the old building properly or have better security measures. Many experts believe this could be one reason why there are fewer fires happening now than before since they can easily spread through old buildings with no sprinklers installed inside them like these ones do today! Some say though if you look closely enough then maybe even more damage might happen during renovations too...so please stay safe everyone out there who reads about how awful events happened recently- just remember we're all humans afterall & deserve respect regardless whether rich poor black white male female etcetera.. So let's hope together as brothers sisters cousins uncles grandparents friends neighbors co workers classmates team members colleagues bosses subordinates clients partners associates etcetera alike!!! And make sure never forgetting those innocent victims whose lives ended prematurely due tragic circumstances beyond anyone control - May God Bless Them All Rest Peacefully Amen!!

He died on 28 February 2021 at the age of 86. His cause of death is unknown but it may have been COVID-19 related. After his death, former president François Hollande called him ""a great man"". He also said that ""he fought all his life for his city and its region."" Prime minister Jean Castex said that ""his attachment to the public service has always been exemplary. It's a loss for everyone. My thoughts are with his family and loved ones. I pay homage to this great servant of Dunkirk who never stopped fighting for his town and its people."" Former prime minister Édouard Philippe tweeted that ""Dunkirk will miss you so much, Mr. Mayor! You gave everything for your city and we owe you so much!""

 ### Assistant: Gilberto José Rodríguez Orejuela (born September 23, 1939) was a Colombian drug lord. He founded the Cali Cartel with his brother Miguel Rodríguez Orejuela and José Santacruz Londoño in 1975. The cartel controlled about 80% of cocaine smuggling into the United States during its heyday between 1986 to 1994. In July 2006, after being on the run for fourteen years, he turned himself over to U.S. authorities. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to thirty years imprisonment at the Federal Correctional Institution in Butner, North Carolina. On May 17, 2014, he was released from prison due to good behavior. He lives now in Medellín under house arrest while awaiting extradition back to the US. His brother Miguel is serving life without parole at ADX Florence. Santacruz died in prison in Colombia. Rodriguez's son Jorge Luis Rodriguez-Orejuela was arrested by DEA agents in Miami Beach in June 2015. He faces charges of conspiracy to import five kilograms or more of cocaine into the United States. He is currently held in Miami Dade County Jail awaiting trial. If convicted, he could face up to forty years in prison. In January 2016, it was reported that he had been deported to Colombia where he will be facing prosecution there as well. It is unknown if this would affect any possible return to the United States should he ever complete his sentence here. As of October 2016, he remains free in Colombia pending an appeal of his case against extradition to the United States. In April 2017, the Supreme Court of Justice rejected his request for protection measures and ordered him to report to court every day until further notice. A judge has ruled that Rodriguez must appear before her daily so she can decide whether he should remain jailed pending the outcome of the extradition proceedings. She said it was important to maintain ""control"" over the defendant because he might flee again. The next hearing is scheduled for June 23rd.

 ### Assistant: Edward the Confessor (; c. 1003 – 5 January 1066), also known as Saint Edward, was King of England from 8 June 1042 AD until his death in 1066. He is called ""Confessor"" because he did not marry and had no children so that he could not be succeeded by an heir. The term ""confessor"" means a person who has confessed their faith in Christ. Edward's succession led to the Norman Conquest of England after his death on 5 January 1066 when William I became king. His canonisation made him the patron saint of England. He was born at Islip, Oxfordshire. He died in London. His mother was Emma of Normandy. Edward the Confessor was named after King Edgar the Peaceful. He was probably educated in Wessex, but went to Normandy for safety during Danish raids. In 1014, Cnut took over England with support from Earl Godwin of Wessex. After Harald II's murder, Cnut sent Edward back to England, where he married Cnut's daughter, Eadgyth of Denmark. He inherited the throne after Cnut's death in 1035. As king, Edward restored many monasteries and churches which were destroyed under Canute. This earned him the name 'Confessor'. In 1066, Harold Godwineson defeated two rival claimants to the English throne, Tostig Godwinsfson and Harald Hardrada. However, within months he was defeated by Duke William of Normandy at Hastings. He was buried in Westminster Abbey. A year later, William claimed the crown. It was said that Edward had promised it to him before he died. Later tradition says that Edward saw six white swans flying overhead just before he died. These are supposed to have been angels carrying his soul to Heaven. There are many stories about miracles performed through the intercession of St Edward. In art, he often appears holding a model of the church he built at Westminster. His feast day is celebrated on October 13th. He was officially recognised as a saint in 1161. Edward the Confessor was declared Patron Saint of England on May 19, 1066. The Order of the Garter was"

74,"### Human: Who is the god of water and the sea in ancient Roman religion and mythology?
 ### Assistant: Neptune (, ; ) was a god from ancient Roman religion and myth. He was the god of water and the sea.  The Romans said he lived at the bottom of the ocean with his wife Salacia. His trident could make waves or calm seas. Some people thought that there were no gods who ruled over the oceans until the arrival of Neptune to Rome. This made him an important addition to their pantheon of deities. In time, however, Neptune came to be seen as just another aspect of Jupiter's power. Because of this, many temples to Neptune doubled as shrines for other gods such as Minerva, Juno and Mars. The main temple of Neptune on the Campus Martius had statues of all these gods inside it. It also held one of the most famous libraries in Ancient Rome. It was called Bibliotheca Neapolitana (""Neapolitan Library""). Today we would call it a ""university library"". When Christianity became popular in Europe during the Middle Ages, churches began being built where pagan temples once stood. One example is St. John Lateran Cathedral in Rome which replaced the Temple of Neptune. Another place where a church took over for a pagan site was Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris. That building used to be a temple dedicated to Jupiter but now houses a statue of Mary holding baby Jesus instead! Even though they are not worshipped anymore by Christians today because they don’t exist anymore due to changes brought about by science discoveries like evolution theory etc., some people still believe in them even if only symbolically through art forms such as literature or music compositions inspired by those belief systems before modern times when everyone agreed upon what constituted reality without questioning its validity too much unlike today where things aren't so clear cut anymore thanks largely due advances made possible through technological innovations throughout history leading up till present day society where everything seems uncertain again after centuries worth progress towards understanding nature better than ever before thanks partly due technological breakthroughs happening every single year since then making life easier while simultaneously creating new problems requiring solutions that weren’t needed previously thus giving rise birth whole industries devoted solely solving specific issues related certain fields/sectors economy overall healthcare system education sector research & development department military defense industry transportation infrastructure construction industry manufacturing sector agriculture production energy generation distribution sector telecommunic"

 ### Assistant: Ronald Erwin McNair (October 21, 1950 – January 28, 1986) was an American physicist and NASA astronaut. He was one of the seven crew members killed in the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster on January 28, 1986. He became a member of the United States Air Force Reserve after college. In 1974 he earned his PhD from MIT. Afterwards, he taught physics at North Carolina A&T State University for three years before being accepted into NASA's space program as part of the sixth group of astronaut candidates in 1978. His first mission was STS-41B aboard the Space Shuttle Challenger in February 1984. During this flight, he conducted two EVAs with fellow astronaut Ellison Onizuka to test techniques that would be used later during construction of the International Space Station. As well as conducting experiments, the pair also deployed two satellites known as Tesla and Spartan. The next year he took part in STS-51L which ended when the shuttle exploded shortly after takeoff due to problems with its solid rocket boosters. All people on board died including Christa McAuliffe who had been selected by NASA to become the first teacher in space. McNair is survived by his wife Cheryl Brown McNair; their son Ronald Erwin McNair Jr.; and his brother Carl McNair. Many places were named in honour of him such as schools, buildings, roads, bridges and even craters on Mars and asteroids. One of these is the McNair High School located near Houston, Texas where all but one of the victims lived. Other things include the Ronald E. McNair Postbaccalaureate Achievement Program which helps low income students get higher education degrees or postgraduate qualifications. This has helped more than 3,000 minority students go onto graduate school since it started. He also received many awards throughout his life including the Congressional Space Medal of Honor in 2004.

77,"### Human: What is taurine and where does it come from?
 ### Assistant: Taurine (2-aminoethanesulfonic acid) is a chemical. It can be found in the body of animals, but not humans. Humans have to get it through food or supplements.  It helps make bile acids which are needed for digestion. Amino acids help build proteins in the human body. The amino group on taurine makes it an essential nutrient for cats because they cannot produce enough themselves. Cats that do not eat meat will develop eye problems if they do not take taurine as a dietary supplement. Taurine also has antioxidant properties. There are no known side effects when taken with other substances. However, there may be interactions between taurine and drugs such as phenelzine sulfate. It comes from two molecules of ethanolamine combined with one molecule each of sulfuric acid and hydrogen peroxide. This reaction produces one molecule of water along with its breakdown products. These include glycerin, pyruvic acid, methylglyoxal, acrolein, and formaldehyde. Other organisms use different pathways to create their own taurine. Some bacteria convert sulfur into thiosulfate while others convert nitrogen into ammonium salts. Both processes require energy so these microbes must consume something else first before making taurine out of them. Bacteria like Escherichia coli make taurine by combining two carbon atoms with three oxygen atoms at room temperature under normal atmospheric pressure using enzymes called “taurase” or ""tetrapyrrolases"". They add another atom onto this chain every time until all four carbons become part of a ring structure containing eight atoms total including itself! Once again, we see how simple chemistry creates complex structures within living things...and vice versa. In fact, almost everything around us today started off as just plain old rocks floating through space billions upon billions ago; then over eons became life forms capable of reproducing themselves through evolutionary changes caused mainly due to mutations occurring during cell division cycles inside our bodies' cells - thus creating diversity among species across planet earth's surface area today.""

 ### Assistant: Sardasht () is a city in West Azerbaijan Province, Iran. It had a population of 63,754 people as of 2011 census. Geography and Climate
Sardasht is located at (). The average elevation above sea level is . This area has an annual precipitation of about , mostly from rain. In this region, snowfall occurs on only one or two days each year. History 
The city suffered a chemical weapons attack by Iraqi forces during the Iran–Iraq War. On June 28, 1987, at least 10,000 civilians were killed when Iraqi warplanes dropped mustard agent bombs on Sardasht. As many as half of its residents died after being exposed to the nerve agents sarin and tabun. Some 30 years later, survivors still suffer serious health problems related to exposure. There are no accurate statistics for how many children have been born with birth defects due to their parents' exposures to these poisons. Many who live in the town today continue to experience skin lesions, respiratory disorders, blindness, cancer, miscarriages and other symptoms associated with exposure to the gases. Most of those affected can never work again because they cannot tolerate even small amounts of physical exertion. Their lives depend upon public assistance. They receive free food, medicine and housing. Other victims require specialized treatment outside of Iran. While some families have received compensation payments from the government, most have not. Those whose family members were injured or lost limbs are entitled to monthly cash benefits paid directly into their bank accounts. But few know where to apply. Only 3 percent of claimants have benefited so far. Others face long delays while their claims are processed. One woman told Amnesty International that she applied for compensation in 2001 but her case remains unresolved. ""We don’t have money to buy bread,"" said another victim. “Every day we go through difficulties.” The chemical attacks took place during the Iran-Iraq War which lasted between September 1980 and August 1988. At least 1 million people – both soldiers and civilians -- on either side were believed to be dead before the conflict ended. During the eight-year war, Ira"

She recorded for MTM Records and Mercury Nashville Records between the mid-1980s to late 1990s. Her best known songs were ""Daddy's Hands"" and ""You Really Had Me Going"". In December 2003 she announced that she had breast cancer but it went into remission in early 2004. On January 12, 2016, her sister Patsy Lynn Russell died of complications from a heart attack at age 64. Two weeks later on March 14, 2016, Holly also died after suffering respiratory failure due to lung cancer. She was aged 58. After her death, her mother Mary Jean Womack wrote a book about her life called Holly Dunn: The Life And Times Of An Angel With A Voice. It is set to be released October 2018. A portion of the proceeds will go towards Breast Cancer Research Foundation. Holly Dunn was buried next to her father William Edward Dunn who died in November 2015.
Her sister Patsy Lynn Russell is buried with them as well. She has three other siblings; two brothers named Mike Dunn and Bruce Dunn and one sister named Laurie Dunn. All four are still alive. Their parents are Bill and Mary Jean Dunn. They have been married since May 1953 when they eloped together. Holly never got married or had children before she passed away. Holly's uncle David Crosby was a famous rock star during his time and he helped launch Holly's career by singing background vocals on some of her albums. He played guitar while she sang lead vocals throughout their entire recording session which lasted approximately six hours total time spent making music altogether. This led him into becoming involved more deeply within this industry where he would eventually become successful himself sometime later down the line. However, not everyone could say this same thing because there were many musicians out there trying hard enough too make something happen just like anyone else does today if given half chance. That being said though I think we can all agree upon how talented these artists truly were even back then"

He received the U.S. military's highest award for valor, the Medal of Honor, on May 5, 1970 by President Richard Nixon at a White House ceremony. He later retired as a captain after serving twenty years in the army. In September 2001, his wife died from cancer. His son is actor Joshua Malina. On March 8, 2021, Jackson died from COVID-19 at a hospital in San Diego, California during the COVID-19 pandemic in California at age 75. Two days earlier, it had been announced that he tested positive with the disease. The news of his death was confirmed through social media. As of April 2021, no funeral arrangements have been made public yet. He will be buried next to his late wife Sharon, who died in 2001. They were married since July 1967 until her death. No children or grandchildren survived him either. Only one brother remains alive today. A memorial service may take place in June 2021 when family members are able to travel again due to restrictions caused by the coronavirus pandemic. It has not been decided whether this will happen online via Zoom or if people can attend physically. If they decide to hold the event virtually then it would likely streamed live over YouTube which could also include pre-recorded messages sent in by friends & relatives including former co-workers like actors Joshua Malina & George Takei among others who knew him personally before he passed away recently last month while being treated there because complications related directly towards contracting covid itself several months ago now unfortunately but thankfully enough time still remained available afterwards allowing them all sufficient opportunity enough needed beforehand so everything turned out fine overall despite initial concerns expressed initially following diagnosis first becoming aware about developments occurring shortly afterward soon afterwards too quickly afterwards right around same general period of time span roughly within similar approximate duration window length range somewhere between two weeks three weeks four weeks five weeks six weeks seven weeks eight weeks nine weeks ten weeks eleven weeks twelve weeks thirteen weeks fourteen weeks fifteen weeks sixteen weeks seventeen weeks eighteen weeks nineteen weeks twenty weeks thirty"
83,"### Human: Who is Edward Snowden and what did he do?
 ### Assistant: Edward Joseph ""Ed"" Snowden (born June 21, 1983) was an American computer professional who worked for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). He also worked at a National Security Agency (NSA) contractor. In May of 2013, while working in Hong Kong, China, Snowden leaked classified information about U.S. surveillance programs to journalists Glenn Greenwald and Laura Poitras. The Guardian newspaper published many articles based on his disclosures. After these revelations, the United States government charged him with espionage and theft of government property. Some people consider him to be a whistleblower. Others say that he broke the law by revealing secrets from the NSA. Other countries have not agreed on whether or not they will allow him asylum. On August 1, 2014, Russia granted Snowden temporary asylum until January 2015. As of February 2016, there are no plans for Snowden's return to the US. His current residence is Moscow, Russia. Snowden has been awarded several awards including the Right Livelihood Award in December 2013, and Sam Adams Associates for Integrity in Intelligence award in October 2013. He received the Freedom of Expression Award 2013 from Index on Censorship. Forbes magazine named him one of its ""Most Powerful People Now"". In March 2017, former President Barack Obama said he would pardon Snowden if given the chance again. However, this statement came after Snowden had already left office. It was therefore considered more symbolic than anything else. A year later, in April 2018, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange stated that Snowden could still receive clemency under Donald Trump’s administration because he “hasn’t done any harm to America”. This statement came just before the first anniversary of when Trump took over the presidency. But it appears unlikely since the president seems very opposed to such a move. In July 2019, Trump told reporters that Snowden should face trial for treason. According to CNN, this may mean that a possible pardon won’t happen soon. In September 2019, Snowden joined Twitter. His account now has almost 6 million followers"

86,"### Human: Who was Galileo Galilei and what is he most remembered for?
 ### Assistant: Galileo Galilei (15 February 1564 – 8 January 1642) was an Italian scientist. He lived in the Renaissance period, when people were interested in science again after a long time of not being so. He made many discoveries about how things worked using mathematics. These included his discovery that the Earth revolved around the Sun rather than vice versa as had been thought at the time. This idea angered the Catholic Church because it went against their beliefs. For this reason they put him under house arrest for eight years before letting him go free. In all, Galileo spent nine months under house arrest altogether. The church did not change its mind until much later. Galileo's father Vincenzo died just six days after his son's birth. His mother Marina raised her two sons alone on a small farm near Pisa. She took great care to educate them well. They learned Greek and Latin together with reading, writing, arithmetic, music, drawing, fencing and dancing. Their uncle Michelangelo taught them geometry and algebra. When Galileo was only twelve years old, he started studying medicine but soon discovered that he found dissection repulsive and abandoned the subject. Instead, he studied maths at the University of Pisa where he earned a doctorate degree in November 1592. After graduating from university, Galileo became professor of mathematics at the University of Padua. Here he began making observations which would eventually lead to his theory of relativity. One day while watching a chandelier swing back and forth inside St Mark’s Cathedral, Venice, Italy; Galileo noticed that no matter how fast or slow it swung, each complete cycle always covered exactly halfway between any two points along its path. From these experiments he concluded that acceleration depends solely upon speed — nothing else affects whether something will accelerate faster or slower over time. This principle forms part of Newtonian mechanics today. During his lifetime Galileo also invented several instruments including telescopes, microscopes, thermometers and barometers. However perhaps his greatest contribution came from astronomy. By observing stars through powerful lenses mounted onto large wooden frames called ""telescopes"", Galileo observed craters on our Moon, Jupiter's moons orbiting around it like planets themselves do around our own planet Earth - thus proving Cop"
87,"### Human: What is Dalby Forest known for?
 ### Assistant: Dalby Forest, or the North York Moors National Park, is a national park in England. It was established on 1 April 2007 and has an area of . The forest is about east from Middlesbrough, north-east from Leeds and southwest from Newcastle upon Tyne. There are two visitor centres - one at Low Dalby near Thirsk and another at Danby near Whitby. Dalby Forest covers most of the land between Rosedale Abbey and Pickering to the west. Its southern boundary is along the A64 road which connects Scarborough with York. To the east it extends as far as Thornton le Dale. Much of its northern border follows the River Derwent, while the eastern boundary includes part of the moorland around Sutton Bank. This rises steeply above the village of Carlton-in-Cleveland. From there, views stretch across the Vale of Mowbray towards Castle Howard and Malton. On clear days, the coastline can be seen, including Filey Brigg, Flamborough Head and Bridlington Bay. To the south-west, the forest reaches into the Cleveland Hills beyond Guisborough. Here, the view stretches down Tees Valley past Stockton-on-Tees and Billingham to Middlesbrough. In the opposite direction, the Pennines rise up over Swaledale. Beyond them, the high ground continues through Wensleydale before descending to the edge of the North Sea at Saltburn-by-the-Sea. Within this landscape are many places of interest such as Hutton-le-Hole, Goathland, Levisham Station, Heartbeat Country (where ITV's series Heartbeat was filmed), Farndale and Osmotherley. Many people come here just to enjoy walking but others take advantage of the opportunities for cycling and horse riding. These activities have been made possible by the creation of miles of paths suitable for all ages and abilities. However, not everyone comes here simply because they like being outdoors. Some visit in order to see the wildlife that lives here. One of the best ways to do this is by taking a walk along the Visitor Trail which runs round the perimeter of the forest. The trail starts at the Low Dalby car park where you will find a small shop"
88,"### Human: What is a sachet d'épices and how is it used?
 ### Assistant: A sachet d’épices (pronounced sah-SHAY day eh-PEECE) or spice bag, is a small pouch containing herbs and/or ground spices. It can be added to the cooking pot at the beginning of making soup stocks, stews or braises in order to flavour them. The contents are usually mixed with butter before adding to the hot liquid. The bag itself may then be removed from the broth before serving. If desired, the bag may remain in the finished meal; however this will give an unpleasant taste if left for too long. This is because the fatty acid inside begins to break down into free fatty acids which have a distinctive bitter taste. Sachets d’epices come as either whole peppercorns or powdered spices. In France they often contain black pepper and bay leaf. They were first invented by Louis XIV's chef Jean Baptiste Poquelin de Mimeure, also known under his stage name Monsieur Molière. He was inspired after seeing fishermen using paper bags filled with salt to preserve their catches. Today these bags are made out of cheese cloth rather than paper. Sometimes other ingredients such as parsley, thyme and chervil are added. These additions depend on what type of food is being prepared. For example if you want something sweet like cake then maybe some vanilla extract would do nicely while if your preference lies more towards savory items then perhaps garlic might work best here! Some people even use coffee grounds instead since they think that gives off better smells when heated up during cooking time . There really isn’t any wrong answer though so experiment until you find one that works well enough for yourself personally speaking :) Hopefully now you know all about those little packets called ""Sachet D'Épices"" ! Have fun trying new recipes today ! Happy Cooking Everyone !! Cheers :) 🍰🥞👩‍🌾📚💪🏼🎉✨😊🙂☺️🤗👋🏻💕❤️���������������������������"

Former U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice added that ""She taught me so much about public service...and life itself. We loved each other like sisters."". Other politicians such as former mayors Phil Hardberger and Henry Cisneros issued statements honoring Connally. Her funeral was held at St. Mark's Episcopal Church with burial following at Fort Sam Houston National Cemetery. Vice-President Joe Biden spoke at her funeral calling her a friend saying ""Idie made sure everyone around her felt welcome and important."". Also speaking were fellow Lieutenant Governors Bill Ratliff and Bob Bullock along with current San Antonio mayor Ron Nirenberg. A statue was dedicated to Connally outside City Hall on October 10, 2018"

 ### Assistant: Plummer (also known as Plumber) is a city in Benewah County, Idaho. It is also the county seat and largest city of Benewah County. The United States Census Bureau says that 1,023 people lived there at the time of the 2010 census. Geography
Plummer has an area of . Of this, is land and is water. Demographics
As of the census of 2010, there were 1,023 people, 478 households, and 256 families living in the city. There are two high schools in Plummer, one being Plummer High School, which is part of the Kendrick Joint School District #496. Also located in Plummer is Kendrick Junior-Senior High School, which is part of the Kendrick School District #404. Both school districts serve students from grades seven through twelve. Kendrick Schools serves grades kindergarten through six. Plummer was founded by William Elias Smith on May 15, 1882. He named it after his son George Washingon Plummer who died while traveling with him to find a suitable location for the town site. In July 1992, a tornado destroyed or damaged about half of the buildings in Plummer, including most of its homes, businesses, churches and schools. No deaths occurred because everyone had been warned earlier by local police officers and firemen who drove around telling residents they needed to get into their basements due to severe weather conditions. A new high school was built afterwards but not before all other structures were rebuilt first so students could return back into classrooms again quickly enough without having too much disruption between semesters like when classes start up again each year after summer break ends. The population grew rapidly during World War II when many workers came here looking for jobs related directly towards helping build military equipment such as aircraft engines used inside planes flying above enemy territory below them where bombs would drop down onto targets below ground level killing innocent civilians along with soldiers alike regardless if they knew what hit em'. This led into another boom period later on once peace treaties began getting signed off upon between countries involved within conflicts causing casualties amongst both sides resulting into needless loss lives lost unnecessarily leading us nowhere near closer together than"

92,"### Human: What is a bistro and what kind of food do they serve?
 ### Assistant: A Bistro (pronounced ""bee-stroh"") is an informal French restaurant. The name comes from the Parisian cafes that used to be called ""bistros"". They usually have simple furniture, such as wooden tables or bar stools. Food 
Bistros generally serve modest meals at moderate prices. In addition to their main courses, many offer desserts, coffee, wine, and other drinks. Some bistros also sell takeout dishes for people who want to eat elsewhere. Their menus may include salads, sandwiches, grilled cheese, soups, burgers, steak frites, quiche lorraine, croque monsieur, pizza, chicken parmesan, spaghetti, mussels, escargots, coq au vin, potato gratin, crème brûlée, and more. Most restaurants are open during certain hours each day, but some bistros stay open all night long so customers can come in anytime after midnight until closing time around dawn. Many people go out to dinner early because it's less expensive than eating later on when most places close up shop. It costs about $10-$25 per person depending on how much you order. If you only get appetizers then expect paying somewhere between $3-$8 per plate. But if you decide to splurge by ordering entrees too then plan on shelling out anywhere between $9-$16 dollars total. There are no set rules though; just ask your server what type of menu items he/she recommends based upon your budget! And remember not every establishment serves alcoholic beverages either...so don't forget those options while making decisions regarding where exactly YOU would prefer going next weekend evening!!! Finally, keep track of how quickly servers bring back orders since this will affect tip amounts given afterwards accordingly...that way nobody gets upset over missing anything important throughout dinner service itself!!
The word “bistro” originated from France’s capital city – Paris. Back in medieval times there were tavern shops known as ‘bistrouille.’ These served basic fare like bread, cheeses, sausage etc., which became popular among working class citizens due its affordability compared against aristocratic cuisine offered by royalty & nobility alike. Over centuries however, these humble establishments"

95,"### Human: What happens to the body during starvation?
 ### Assistant: Starvation is a severe lack of food. It can lead to death if it goes on for too long, and will cause weight loss. The first thing that happens when someone starts to become malnourished is that they lose their appetite. This means that they do not feel hungry even though there is no food in them. They also have less energy than normal because some of the cells are being used up by the liver or muscles. These changes happen over time as more calories leave the system through urine or sweat. As this continues, people may experience symptoms such as headaches, dizziness, weakness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain (stomach cramps), cold extremities like hands and feet due to poor circulation caused from low blood pressure levels which makes capillaries constrict so much water leaks out causing dehydration along with electrolyte imbalance resulting into seizures or coma depending upon how far gone one's condition has progressed without treatment given soon enough after initial onset began occurring within 24 hours since last meal consumed before becoming ill suddenly due either an accident involving injuries requiring hospitalization where IV fluids were administered intravenously through veins located at elbow joint area close proximity towards wrist bend where arteries branch off providing oxygenated red cells flowing throughout entire organism via capillary network connecting every cell together forming complex webwork pattern enabling efficient distribution process ensuring adequate amounts reach all areas needed most effectively possible while avoiding unnecessary waste production since only those parts necessary receive sufficient nutrients required maintain optimal health status currently achieved under circumstances presented herein discussed previously mentioned above briefly summarized succinctly stated concisely expressed compact form short manner efficiently conveyed accurately communicated clearly understood comprehensively analyzed thoroughly investigated carefully scrutinized meticulously examined cautiously inspected critically evaluated methodologically processed scientifically tested experimentally verified objectively confirmed empirically proven rationally established logically deduced mathematically calculated statistically computed statistically determined numerically derived analytically modeled predictably estimated theoretically projected hypothetically conjectured speculatively postulated tentatively assumed presumptuously supposed prematurely guessed approximately approximated vaguely inferred indirectly surmised haphaz"

 ### Assistant: Alfred George James Hayes (born 1954) was a New Zealand politician. He served as Mayor of Whakatāne from 2007 to 2016 and Member of Parliament for Waiariki between 2011 to 2013. He won the seat in the general election on November 26, 2011 with 8,782 votes or 45% of the vote. In October 2012 he announced that he would resign his parliamentary seat effective December 1, 2012 to focus on his mayoral duties. His resignation became official after the new year began. The by-election for his seat occurred on February 17, 2013 and Labour's candidate Tamati Coffey won the election. After leaving politics, Hayes returned to farming. He has been married since 1985; they have two children together. He is also an accomplished rugby league player having played for the national team in 1978. He is a member of the Māori Party. He left the party in July 2013 because he thought it had become too focused on its own survival rather than improving issues affecting Maori people. Instead, he joined the National Party. On May 25, 2014, Prime Minister John Key appointed him Associate Minister for Primary Industries. However, Hayes lost this position when the National government formed a coalition with the ACT Party following the September 2014 elections. This caused some controversy among members of the Māori Party who felt that Hayes should not be punished for joining another political party. In April 2015, however, the party reinstated him into their caucus. In June 2015, Hayes said that he wanted to run again for the leadership of the Māori Party. But he did not get enough support to challenge Marama Fox. In March 2016, he decided against running for mayor again. Te Aniwa Hurihanganui won instead. From then until January 2018, he worked at the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment. Since then he has worked for the Eastern Bay of Plenty District Council. He ran for Mayor of Whakatane once more during the "
97,"### Human: What is the chemical formula and properties of bismuthine?
 ### Assistant: Bismuthine, also known as bismercuric oxide or mercury(II) oxidobismuthate, is a compound. Its chemical formula is BiO2Hg. It has both bismuth and mercury in it. The bismuth is in its +3 oxidation state. Properties
Bismuthine dissolves in acids to make solutions that contain the [Bi(OH)(Hg)]- ion. It turns yellow when heated. It does not react with water. Preparation 
It can be made by adding hydrogen peroxide to an alkaline solution containing bismuth salts. It is usually made by mixing potassium cyanide with nitric acid on some bismuth salt. History
Bismuthine was first described in 1840. It was called ""bismutite"" at first because people thought it contained only bismuth. They found out later it had mercury too. In 1957, the name ""bismercuric oxide"" became official for this compound. Uses
Bismuthine is used in making plastic explosives such as PETN. When mixed with triacetone triperoxide (TATP), bismuthine makes a very powerful explosive. Safety information
Bismuthine is harmful if swallowed. If it gets into the eyes, rinse them well with clean running water. Wear gloves and protective glasses when handling it. Do not breathe dust from bismuthine. Keep away from heat and open flames. Dispose of waste properly. This substance may catch fire easily. Store bismuthine in air tight containers in cool places where there are no sparks or other sources of ignition. It should not come into contact with bases like ammonia. If it comes near these things, it will form poisonous gases including nitrogen dioxide. These can cause lung damage. Bismuthine could explode if it touches metal surfaces, especially those coated with silver. It should never be handled with bare hands. Use tongs or forceps instead. Avoid breathing dust from bismuthine. People who handle bismuthine need to wear protective clothing and respirators. There might be cancer risks from working with bismuthine. More"

 ### Assistant: Mary Holt (1940 – 28 January 2021) was an Australian politician. She was a member of the Liberal Party. She served as the President of the Legislative Assembly from 1976 to 1978, and again in 1985. In 1983 she became the first woman Speaker of any Australian parliamentary house when she took over as speaker of the New South Wales Parliament after Peter Sinclair's resignation on health grounds. She retired at age 65, which is mandatory for speakers in NSW, but returned later that year to fill out the term until 1985. She also won the inaugural National Trust Award for Outstanding Contribution to Conservation in Australia. Holt died on 28 January 2021 at the age of 80. Her death came just two weeks before the state election. The seat had been held by the Liberals since its creation in 1988. It was vacated with no one nominated as a candidate. A by-election will be held in August. At the time of her death, it was unclear who would run as a candidate. Holt did not have children or siblings so there are few close relatives left alive. There has only ever been one other female speaker in the history of the NSW Parliament; Kaye Patterson in 2007–08. This means Holt holds this position longer than anyone else. She also served more terms as president of the legislature than anybody else too. She was born in Sydney. On 2 February 2021, Premier Gladys Berejiklian announced that the electorate of Charlton would be renamed ""Holt"" in honour of Holt. The change will come into effect following the next general election. However, if the seat changes hands between now and then, the name will stay ""Charlton"". If a new MP takes office, they can choose whether or not to keep the seat named ""Holt"". If they do not wish to retain the name, it reverts back to ""Charlton"", though the decision remains their own choice. Berejiklian said the idea was suggested by Deputy Leader John Barilaro and he thought it appropriate given how long Holt served. He added that the move would serve as a fitting tribute to Holt"
