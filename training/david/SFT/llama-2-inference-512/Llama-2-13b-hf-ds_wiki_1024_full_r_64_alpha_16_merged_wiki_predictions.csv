 ### Assistant: The 7.62×39mm (aka .30 Russian) is a rifle cartridge used in many Soviet weapons, including the AK-47 and SKS series of firearms. It was developed by the Soviets during World War II as an intermediate round between pistol and full power rifles such as the German Mauser Karabiner 98k or US M1 Garand. This allowed for lighter weight weaponry with more stopping power than smaller caliber rounds but less recoil than larger ones like .30–06 Springfield or 7.92x57mm Mauser. Its popularity has made it one of the most widely produced ammunition types worldwide today due to its low cost compared to other similar products on market shelves at present time. Many countries produce their own versions based off original design specifications set forth by Russia back then when this type first came into being around 1940s era military conflicts involving USSR against Nazi Germany forces occupying Eastern Europe territories under control beforehand prior start date given above here nowadays still being referred too whenever discussing subject matter related thereto henceforth forwardly moving onto next paragraph below without further ado so we may continue reading along accordingly thereafter...

2,"### Human: What was the name of the French colony that later became the Republic of Dahomey?
 ### Assistant: The Kingdom of Porto-Novo (or Portuguese town) was a French colony in West Africa. It lasted from 1724 until 1850, when it was replaced by the Republic of Dahomey. Its capital city is now called Cotonou and it belongs to Benin. History
In the early years, this area was controlled by the King of Whydah. In 1690 he died without an heir, so his kingdom broke up into three parts. One part went to Ouidah. Another part went to Savi, which had been founded as a slave trading post in 1723 by Dutch merchants working for the Royal African Company. This company had a monopoly on trade with west coast Africa. They were based at El Mina Castle near Accra. The third part went to a relative who moved northwards and set up the new kingdom of Abomey. Soon afterwards, Savi fell under control of the Kingdom of Allada, further east along the coast. When they invaded Savi in 1724, France decided to take over the whole region and make it their own colony. That way they could keep all of the slaves produced there for themselves rather than having to share them out among other European nations. A French governor arrived in September 1724 and built Fort de l'Amitie. He also made peace treaties with some local rulers. These are known as ""The Treaties of Peace and Friendship"". The French took over control of all of what used to be the Kingdom of Whidah. However, they did not have enough money or soldiers to defeat the powerful Kingdom of Dahomey to the south. So they left it alone and just tried to trade with them instead. Over time, more and more people came to live around the fort. By 1728, the population included about 200 Europeans plus many blacks. Mostly these were former slaves freed by the French. Also living here were several hundred local people who worked as farmers or fishermen. About half of them lived outside the walls of the fort itself. Some of them may even have been refugees from wars between different groups within this area before then. There were also about 200 Muslim Hausa traders based nearby too. They helped carry goods back and forth across Africa via caravans travelling through desert"
3,"### Human: What is the name and some characteristics of a moon of Saturn?
 ### Assistant: Methone (; ) is a moon of Saturn. Its discovery was announced by Scott S. Sheppard, David C. Jewitt, Jan Kleyna, and Brian G. Marsden on June 26, 2005 from observations taken between December 18, 2004, and March 7, 2005. Methone is about in diameter, making it one of Saturn's smallest moons. It orbits just outside the G ring at . Because of its location near this outer edge of the main rings, Methone experiences tidal flexing as it passes through them. This effect has caused fractures to form within the moon's surface crust. The cracks are visible when viewed with high-resolution telescopes such as Cassini. Methone also shows evidence for internal heating that may be due to radioactive decay within its interior. However, the amount of heat generated would only warm up its subsurface layers rather than causing melting. If there were any liquid water below the frozen surface, it would not stay there long enough to erode away much material. Methone's density suggests an ice composition similar to other small inner satellites. Although the moon could have been formed further out where temperatures might allow volatile materials like ammonia hydrate to remain stable, its current position does not support such conditions. Instead, scientists think that Methone was most likely captured into orbit around Saturn after being ejected from the asteroid belt by Jupiter's gravity. In this scenario, Methone originated in the Kuiper belt before getting thrown off course towards our solar system's largest planet by gravitational interactions with larger bodies closer inwards towards Uranus and Neptune. When it got close enough for Jupiter's influence to become significant again, it became trapped in an elliptic path which eventually brought it under Saturn’s sway instead of continuing past Titan as originally intended because no known object can escape once caught within Saturn's sphere of influence unless something else intervenes first. Therefore we know now why many objects end up becoming part of systems they weren't meant for! We hope you enjoyed learning about Methone today! You should check back soon so see what new information comes available tomorrow too!! Thanks for reading :)

4,"### Human: What is the Rambla de las Ovejas and where is it located?
 ### Assistant: The Rambla de las Ovejas (English: Sheep Trail) is a small river in Spain. It flows through the province of Valencia, near Castellón. Its source is at 1047 meters above sea level on Mount Penyagolosa. At its mouth it empties into the Albaida River. In total it has a length of about . It was named after sheep that used to graze there because they were so numerous. Nowadays only some wild goats can be seen along this trail which leads up to the top of Montañeta mountain range from Benifallet village. This area offers many hiking trails for all levels; however due to recent floods access may not always be possible depending upon weather conditions during certain times throughout year when rainfall occurs more frequently than normal seasons like summer months when temperatures are warmer allowing easier navigation without getting wet feet while walking around streams etcetera..
The watercourse begins as two branches flowing downhill towards each other until they merge together forming one main stream called ""Rambla"". From here it continues southwards crossing over several bridges before reaching an old railway station known locally as La Estación Del Ferrocarril De Carboneras De Guadalajara. After passing underneath this structure we find ourselves standing next to another bridge spanning across yet another tributary coming directly out from beneath us - El Río Bravo y Blanco! We now follow our pathway further westwardly leading onto another section referred simply by locals just 'La Rambla' itself – although technically speaking should actually read 'El Camino Real'. Finally arrives back at point A where started journey began earlier today... All told took approximately four hours including breaks taken en route plus waiting time spent waiting patiently outside train stations whilst others boarded trains going elsewhere before finally catching mine home again safe & sound albeit slightly tired but happy nonetheless knowing full well how much fun had been experienced throughout entire day long adventure.... So now let me tell you little bit history behind why did I choose take walk instead driving car round town centre because first thing need remember here is fact most people living within vicinity prefer using bus service whenever travelling short distances since costs less expensive compared paying taxi fare plus saves money gasoline/petrol too! Second reason being majority population working class families rely heavily public transportation systems provide them cheap way travel between work place school home"
5,"### Human: What is an anvil used for?
 ### Assistant: An anvil is a piece of metal that has been made into the shape of a triangle. It can be hit with hammers to make other things harder and stronger, such as iron or steel. They are usually kept on a stand called an anvil block so they don't move around when being worked upon. The word comes from the Latin word ""anvils"" which means ""hammer"". This name was given because anvils were first used by blacksmiths who would use them to hammer out hot pieces of metal like nails or rivets (a type of screw). In modern times, however, most people think about anvils in terms of their ability to provide support for heavy objects while being struck repeatedly by another object - typically either wood or stone. A good example might include building up parts inside your car engine before putting it back together again after repair work has been done elsewhere! 
Another common usage involves using an anvil instead of sandpaper when shaping tools such as chisels and planes; this way you get less dust than if you had just tried scrubbing away at whatever material needed cleaning off without any protection whatsoever!! 
The reason why we call something 'an anvil' today stems partly due to its history whereby smiths would often use these implements during medieval times whenever there wasn’t enough room available within their homes/workshops etc., thus leading onto our current terminology.""
In ancient Greece, they also referred to similar items but called them ""axe-heads"". These days though many countries still refer to those same types of devices under different names depending upon region – e.g.: French “marteau” German “hämmerchen”, Italian “martello”. Even though all three words mean “small hammer”, each language uses slightly different connotations associated with said item(s) based solely off cultural differences between nations/countries over time periods spanning centuries ago until present day events occur simultaneously throughout various regions across globe. However despite varying definitions among speakers worldwide there remains one thing constant regardless how old someone may become: every person knows exactly what kind tool requires striking against hard surface area in order produce desired outcome whether working alone outside home environment doing repairs manually or operating machinery indoors requiring precision measurements taken accurately via hand held device measuring unit prior beginning process step #1 followed closely behind sequence completion stage two completing final task necessary complete"

 ### Assistant: King Kong (also called K.K.) is a fictional giant monster gorilla who has appeared in many movies, books, comics, video games and television shows since 1933. The character was first created by Edgar Wallace for the novelization of the movie Merian C. Cooper's King Kong. He is one of Universal Studios most famous characters. He has been played by different actors over time including Fay Wray, Jeff Bridges and Naomi Watts. In recent years he has also become an iconic figure on popular culture. A new version of the film will be released sometime around late December or early January. It stars Andy Serkis as the voice of Kong with Tom Hiddleston playing Captain James Conrad. It is directed by Jordan Vogt-Roberts. The trailer was shown at Comic-Con International 2016. A sequel to this rebooted series was announced in March 2018 but it is unknown if it would continue after that date because there are no details about when production starts nor any release dates set yet so far except that it might happen during summer 2019 depending on how long they take making their next movie which means another year could pass before we see anything else from them again unless something changes between now then later down line where things start happening faster than expected due to unforeseen circumstances such as weather conditions affecting schedules etcetera...
 
The original idea came from producer Merian C. Cooper, who wanted to make a big adventure picture. Carl Denham wrote the story and Ernest B. Schoedsack co-directed with him; both were experienced explorer/filmmakers whose documentaries included Grass: A Nation’s Battle For Life (1925) and Chang: A Drama Of The Wilderness (1927). They had just returned from Africa where they shot footage of wild animals being killed by hunters while shooting scenes for Trader Horn (1931), starring Harry Carey Sr., who plays Captain Englehorn here too! This scene inspired them create King Kong himself – originally named ‘Behemoth,’ until someone pointed out its similarity with Beethoven's Fifth Symphony…and thus became known forevermore simply as “Kong.” The rest is history...

 ### Assistant: Natalia Leonidovna Krachkovskaya (; 14 April 1958 – 20 September 2021) was a Russian politician. She was the Minister of Education and Science from February to May 2013 during Dmitry Medvedev's second term as President. She was also Deputy Chairman of United Russia from 2006 until her death in 2021. She served as First Vice-President of the State Council under Vladimir Putin since 2017. On 20 September, she died at the age of 63. The cause of her death is unknown but it may have been COVID-19 or cancer because she had both before dying. Her funeral took place on 22 September 2021 at Moscow Kremlin. After that, her body was buried in Novodevichy Convent Cemetery. A day after her burial, Sergei Shoigu announced his resignation as Defense Minister. He said he wanted to be with his family following Krachkovskaya's death. This caused many people to speculate if they were having an affair behind their spouses backs for years. However, this has not been confirmed yet by anyone close to them. In October 2021, it was reported that Shoigu did not attend Krachkovskaya's funeral due to being ill. His daughter Anna Shoigina denied these claims saying ""Dad wasn’t sick"". It later came out that Shoigu was actually in Turkey meeting Turkish officials about the Syrian Civil War when Krachkovskaya passed away. The reports claiming that he was sick were false according to his daughters statement which led some media outlets like RT News and TASS News Agency reporting incorrectly without any confirmation or evidence proving otherwise other than what Anna said herself online through social networks such as Instagram where users could see pictures posted showing him looking healthy despite rumors circulating around suggesting otherwise including one stating how 'seriously unwell' he looked while attending meetings abroad related directly towards ending conflicts between countries involved within Syria's civil war zone area borders near Eastern Mediterranean Sea shores respectively speaking specifically regarding refugee crisis issues arising daily across Europe affecting millions living there currently today still waiting patiently awaiting answers provided soon hopefully so everyone knows exactly what happened leading up till now finally coming clean"

11,"### Human: What is the format of MPEG-1 and/or MPEG-2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)?
 ### Assistant: The MP3 audio file format, also known as MPEG-1 and/or MPEG-2 Audio Layer 3 (MPEG-1 or -2 ALS), is a digital audio encoding system. It was made by Moving Picture Experts Group in 1990s. Today it is one of the most popular formats for playing music on computers. Many people use this format because they can compress large files into small ones without losing quality. This means that you can fit more songs onto your device than if you used other types of audio compression such as WAVE or OGG Vorbis which are uncompressed formats with no lossy conversion taking place during playback time at all so there will be less chance for errors while listening through headphones etc., but these same benefits come at cost: lower bitrate levels lead directly towards poorer sound quality overall when compared against higher rates where higher fidelity has been achieved beforehand via careful tuning processes done manually prior to encoding stage completion – thus making sure nothing gets lost along way either due lack skill set needed perform said task properly first off OR simply due too much pressure placed upon programmer responsible maintaining codebase integrity throughout entire development lifecycle since beginning until end point reached after many months worth effort put forth trying make everything perfect every step way possible!
The main reason why mp3's became so popular over past few decades though? Because unlike its predecessors like RealAudio or Windows Media Player etc., it does not require special software installed onto user machine order enjoy full functionality; instead just needs player application preloaded onto computer already present within operating system itself–thus saving both money & space required store additional programs locally versus streaming them remotely across network connections from server farms located elsewhere around world depending upon location preference chosen by each individual consumer at given moment time being considered herein question mark (?).

 ### Assistant: The Walt Disney Concert Hall is a concert hall in Los Angeles, California. It was designed by Frank Gehry and built from 1987 to 2003. It seats about 2,265 people. It is home of the Los Angeles Philharmonic orchestra. In 2004 it won an award for Best Orchestra Performance. Other awards include the International Stirling Prize (2003), the Brunner Prize (2003) and the National AIA Honor Award (2004). This building has been called ""the most important new building"" in the city since the Coliseum. Many say that this building is one of the best buildings in the world. Some have said that it could be compared with some of the great cathedrals of Europe. There are many other modern landmarks on Bunker Hill including the US Bank Tower and the Wells Fargo Center. Also nearby is the Broad Art Foundation's Contemporary art museum. These are all within walking distance of each other. However there is no easy way to get between them without going up and down steep hills. All these buildings are connected only by sidewalks and streets which go around them at right angles. For example you can not walk straight across Grand Avenue because of skyscrapers blocking your path both east and west along Grand Avenue until you reach First Street where there is another large office tower blocking your view southward toward City Hall. Even if you wanted to cross over Second Street you would still need stairs as well as elevators due its steepness; but once again there isn’t any direct access point available anywhere near here either so unless someone drove their car up onto top level parking lots located above ground floor levels below street level then they wouldn’t even know what direction they were headed towards anyway!

 ### Assistant: The Church of Saint Paul (Swedish: Sankt Pauls kyrka) is a church in the Vasastaden district in central Stockholm, Sweden. It was built between 1925 and 1930 after plans by architect Sigurd Lewerentz who also designed its furniture. His style combines simplicity with an organic expressionism that has been compared to Frank Lloyd Wright's work. In 2006 it became one of four Swedish churches on UNESCO's World Heritage list as part of the ""Churches of Dalecarlia"". It belongs to the Diocese of Stockholm in the Church of Sweden. Its parish (församling) is called St Pauli församling. This parish covers all parts of Vasastan except for the area around Kungsholmen which belongs to Västermalms församling. The congregation consists mainly of university students from Stockholm University. A small group of people are members of other Christian denominations such as Baptists or Pentecostals. There is no regular Sunday service but there are special services at Christmas time. On Fridays during Lent there will be evening prayer services every week starting at six o'clock pm followed by supper afterwards until nine thirty pm when everyone goes home together singing hymns along their way back home again after having spent some hours talking about spiritual matters beforehand over dinner instead of eating out somewhere else later on if they wanted too because most restaurants close early anyway so why not just stay where you were already going anyways right?

Another well-known band who played this kind of music were Nile. Some other examples include Acheron, Antaeus, Disgorge, Gorguts, Hate Eternal, Immolation, Malevolent Creation, Marduk, Melechesh, Nocturnus, Vader, Incantation, Decrepit Birth, Arsis, Waking the Cadaver, Abigail Williams and Goatwhore. Other groups such as Destroyer 666, Watain, Dark Funeral and Satyricon have been described as playing blackened death metal, although they do not use the term themselves. This style has become very popular recently with many new bands forming around the world including Asphyx, Angelcorpse, Pestilence, Seance, Morbid Saint, Blasphemy, Sadistic Intent, Merciless, and Unholy Ghost. There are some differences between blackened death metal and melodic black metal; however there are similarities too. Most songs sound slower or faster depending on what tempo they're being performed at. For example if you listen closely enough then sometimes when someone sings about something sad or happy then their voice will change accordingly which makes them seem more emotional towards whatever topic they're singing about. Sometimes people might even cry while listening because these kinds of lyrics can touch our hearts so deeply. Even though I don’t agree with everything he says but I still respect him greatly because his work ethic really shows through every single track off each record he puts out whether good or bad reviews come back afterwards doesn’t matter much anymore nowadays since nobody cares anyway unless your name happens to rhyme with “Beyonce” or something else equally stupid sounding…I digress anyways back onto subject matter here we go again haha jk lolz just kidding man chill out already okay?!?!??!!1"

18,"### Human: Who is the bass player in Soundgarden?
 ### Assistant: Ben Shepherd (born August 20, 1968) is an American musician. He plays bass guitar and sings backing vocals for the rock band Soundgarden. Personal life 
Shepherd was born on August 20, 1968 in Orange County, California. In 1975 his family moved to Seattle where he grew up with a brother and sister. When he was fourteen years old he started playing guitar but then switched to bass when he joined Hiroshima Mon Amour. After graduating from high school he worked as a carpenter while working at various odd jobs such as dishwasher and bartender. Later he went back to college studying architecture. His father died of cancer in November 1994. Shepherd lives in Seattle. On May 30th, 2017, it was reported that Shepherd had been diagnosed with stomach cancer, which required him to undergo surgery soon after. The operation was successful, though Shepherd has not played since due to recovery time. It is unknown if or when he will return to play live shows again. As of January 2018, Shepherd's cancer has returned and is spreading throughout his body. He may have only six months left to live according to some sources. Shepherd remains positive about his condition, however, saying ""I’m still here! I’ve got this thing beat."" He also says he plans to continue touring with Soundgarden through their farewell concert series in North America. This decision has led many fans to question whether they should attend any remaining concert dates out of respect. Some even say that attending these events would be disrespectful towards those who are suffering from terminal illnesses themselves. Others argue that by continuing performing live shows despite having stage IV metastatic melanoma, Shepherd demonstrates strength against adversity; something which inspires others battling similar diseases around them every day. Regardless of what people think about his choice regarding future performances within this context specifically, there can no doubt that Ben continues fighting hard each moment until death finally takes away everything else except memories shared between friends during difficult times like this one now experienced firsthand across our planet earth today... And hopefully someday soon enough so everyone involved gets closure too because nobody deserves pain eternal without end unless otherwise stated"

 ### Assistant: , also known as (1406 – 23 April 1478), was the wife of Ashikaga Yoshimochi. She was the mother of Ashikaga Yoshihisa, Shogun of Japan from 1459 to 1473. Her name is sometimes written . Her father was Hōjō Sadaaki. Her grandfather was Hōjō Tokiyuki. One of her brothers was Hōjō Ujiyasu who became shugo of Odawara in 1441. Another brother was Hōjō Fusatsugu. Two of her sisters were married into the Takeda clan. The eldest daughter married Takeda Nobumasa. A younger daughter married Takeda Nobushige. After she died, her son took over as head of the family. His name was Hōjō Sanade. He had a son named Hōjō Tsunetoki. In 1495 he became the shogun. When his father died, he took over as leader of the family. He kept that job until he himself died. There are no surviving records about him or his life. That is why we do not know if he ever got married. If he did get married then there would be another generation after this one. This means that people can trace their lineage back through generations on both sides of their families using documents like wills or marriage contracts. However these types of documents often only give limited information about how many children someone has at any given time period because they don’t tell us anything more than just whether or not somebody existed during certain periods throughout history when writing them down might have been difficult due to warfare conditions etcetera which could make it hard for writers/scribes working under such circumstances try keeping track accurately enough so everything gets recorded properly without mistakes being made along way causing confusion later down road among future researchers trying figure things out based off incomplete sets data collected earlier times.."

21,"### Human: What is a shotgun and how does it work?
 ### Assistant: A shotgun is a firearm that shoots many small pellets at once. It can be used for hunting or self-defense, but most people use them to shoot clay targets in sporting events like trap shooting or skeet shooting. Shotguns are usually long guns with two barrels; one on each side of the gun body called ""barrels"". The bullets come out through these holes when you pull back on this lever which causes air pressure inside the chamber (the space between both barrels) so there's enough force behind every bullet fired from those chambers at once instead of just one single round being sent down range by itself without any help whatsoever! This makes them very powerful weapons because they have more power than other types of rifles do due to their design structure where all parts move together during recoil rather than having separate pieces moving independently against each other like some bolt action rifles might require before firing again after emptying its magazine.""  There are different kinds of shells available depending upon whether your goal is recreational target practice or home defense purposes only though so make sure not get confused about which kind would suit best based off your needs alone since choosing incorrectly could lead towards disaster later down road if things don't go according plan initially thought up ahead time period prior purchase decision made finalized accordingly within budget limits set forth previously agreed upon terms conditions laid out beforehand signed contract written agreement drawn up legally binding document stating intentions clearly understood thoroughly explained completely detailed manner leaving no room doubt remaining unanswered questions left hanging open ended issues unresolved problems still lingering around waiting resolution eventually answered satisfactorily resolved satisfactorily addressed fully completed successfully finished product delivered successfully accepted received positively acknowledged appreciated highly praised commended rewarded recognized appropriately compensated duly honored given credit deservedly earned rightfully obtained fairly won awarded properly merited correctly granted honorably presented graciously received politely welcomed warmly greeted cordially invited hospitably hosted gladly entertained kindly accommodated courteously treated pleasantly met agreeably seen favorably viewed nicely looked nice well liked good enjoyed much better pleased happy content satisfied delighted ecstatic thrilled excited elated cheerful jubilant joyous blissful gleeful triumphant exuberant radiant bright cheery gay luminous sunny vibrant ebullient animated energetic spirited sprightly sparkling"

 ### Assistant: Christiaan Neethling ""Chris"" Barnard (8 November 1922 – 2 September 2001) was a South African cardiac surgeon. He is best known for the world's first human-to-human heart transplant, which he performed on Louis Washkansky in December 1967 at Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town, South Africa. The operation lasted five hours and four days after surgery, Washkansky died of pneumonia caused by immunosuppressive drugs given to him so his body would not reject the donor organ. Barnard made medical history again when he successfully repaired an infant’s congenital heart defect using a new technique that became standard practice throughout the world. This procedure helped babies born with such problems live longer than they otherwise might have done. In addition to these achievements, Chris Barnard also pioneered many other important procedures including open-heart surgery and lung cancer treatment. His work has saved millions of lives around the globe over more than fifty years as one of medicine’s most influential figures ever since then until today where there are still people who benefit from what he did during those early times before modern technology existed or even thought about being invented yet alone used regularly enough nowadays due mainly because we know how dangerous certain things can be if left untreated long enough without proper care taken into account while doing so... It wasn't just doctors though; nurses played their part too! They had lots going on behind closed doors but thankfully nobody knows much except maybe some old timers who worked alongside Dr B himself back then.. And finally let me say this : We should always remember our heroes no matter how small/big role(s)they play(d). If it weren't for them then none of us could exist here today living happily ever after like fairy tale endings where everyone gets married off nicely & lives happily ever after!!!

 ### Assistant: Bulgogi () is a dish in Korean cuisine. It was made by Koreans, but the exact origins of bulgogi are unknown. The name comes from the word ""neobul gogi"" which means ""fire meat"". There is another theory that says that this food came from Mongolia because Genghis Khan's army had many horses. They cooked horse meat on fire during their travel to Korea. In modern times, people eat beef instead of horse meat. People can also use other meats like pork or chicken. Nowadays, most restaurants serve this with rice, vegetables, and kimchi. Most people make this at home for special occasions such as birthdays or holidays. Some families even have secret recipes passed down through generations! Bulgoji is usually served with lettuce leaves so you can wrap them up into little packages called ssam (). You then dip your wrapped leaf into sauce before eating it! This dish has become very popular around the world since its creation back when Korea first started becoming known internationally after World War II ended in 1953. Many foreigners now enjoy trying out different types of food while visiting South Korea today too. However, some may find certain flavors difficult if they aren’t used to spicy tastes yet; therefore I recommend starting off slowly until gradually building tolerance over time – just don’t forget about drinking plenty amounts water afterwards though :) !!! Also remember not everyone likes seafood so please keep those preferences mindfulness always . Lastly , there exist multiple varieties depending upon region thus making each version unique unto itself regardless whether one prefers sweetness versus saltiness etcetera...so experiment away freely without fearing judgmental eyes watching every move made along way towards mastery level status achieved eventually!!! Good luck friends :D Happy Cooking !!"

 ### Assistant: Vermont is a state in the northeastern United States. It borders Massachusetts to its south, New Hampshire to its east, and New York on the west side of Lake Champlain. On October 7th, 1804 it became the fourteenth U.S. state after being separated from the land that would become Maine (which was part of Massachusetts at the time). The capital city is Montpelier; the largest city by population is Burlington. As of 2015, about 623,989 people live there. Its area is . This makes it the second smallest state by size but the sixth least populated one out of all fifty states in America. In this way, each person has more space than they do in most other places around them! People who were born or raised here are called ""Vermonters"". They have nicknames like Green Mountain Boys because their home looks green when seen from far away due to many trees growing there as well as mountains rising up above sea level making it look higher than some others nearby such as California which only reaches an altitude halfway through Wyoming's Rockies range before dropping off sharply towards Mexico below groundwater table levels where no life exists anymore except bacteria found deep within our planet's crust beneath us today. Vermont also produces maple syrup every year since colonial times so much so that even though Canada grows twice as much per capita compared with Americans living northward along border lines between countries sharing common cultural heritage traditions back centuries ago including French-speaking Canadians nowadays too – not just English speakers either -even if you don’t know any words yourself yet still enjoy tasting sweet treats made using sap extracted directly from sugar maples grown wild across vast regions stretched coastline boundaries spanning continents overseas until reaching ocean shores everywhere else worldwide where similar climates exist allowing same species thrive without need worrying whether climate change might affect future generations negatively unlike what happened during last century when temperatures rose dramatically causing drought conditions leading crop failures resulting famine deaths among millions starving children left behind unable feed themselves adequately enough stay alive long term survival prospects looked bleak indeed unless something done quickly enough save situation before things got worse…and thankfully did happen eventually prevent disaster happening again hopefully sometime soon...so we can breathe sigh relief knowing everything"

36,"### Human: What is the title and artist of the painting ""Ideal Landscape with a Young Man Killing a Snake""?
 ### Assistant: Ideal Landscape with a Young Man Killing a Snake, also called The Hunter (), is an oil on canvas painted by Jan Brueghel in 1608. It measures 93 cm x 75 cm. This work was part of the collection of the Earl of Pembroke at Wilton House until it went to the National Gallery London in 1947. A copy made for James I hangs in Holyrood Palace. Another version, attributed to Pieter van Laer, was sold at auction in 2014. Its whereabouts are unknown. Other copies were done later; one from around 1650-1660 now hangs in Hampton Court Palace. A fourth copy was bought by Charles II. He hung this one over his bed at Whitehall Palace. Later kings would move it between palaces as they wished. It can be seen today hanging in Buckingham Palace. In 1616 Rubens wrote about another copy he had commissioned from Van Dyck. It has been lost since then. There may have been more than four versions of the picture. It's possible that there could have been up to ten. Art historians know very little about how many different paintings existed or who created them. Some might not even exist anymore. However, art historians agree that all these works came out of Bruegel's studio. They think that most if not all of them were made under Bruegel's direction. Most likely, other artists working in his shop did much of the actual painting. Only some of them signed their names to the finished product. The young man killing the snake isn’t identified but scholars believe him to be Amadis de Gaula, a heroic figure from Spanish literature. When the king saw this image, he thought it looked like Prince Henry, his son. The prince died just two years after seeing the painting. King James believed this scene showed his son doing something brave and noble. His death happened so soon afterwards that no one knew what caused it. Many people suspected poisoning because the snakebite didn't look fatal enough to kill someone within hours. At the time, doctors said you couldn't die from a snake bite unless the fang pierced your heart. But the wound itself wouldn't cause instantaneous death. People still got bitten every year without"

 ### Assistant: Van Helsing (2004) is a fantasy horror movie. It was directed by Stephen Sommers and stars Hugh Jackman as the main character, Gabriel ""Van"" Helsing, an immortal monster hunter. The movie also has Kate Beckinsale as Anna Valerious, David Wenham as Carl, Will Kemp as Aleera and Shuler Hensley as Count Vladislaus Dracula. This movie is based on Universal Studios's classic Monsters franchise, which includes Frankenstein, The Mummy, Wolf Man, Creature from the Black Lagoon and Invisible Man. The film received mixed reviews but made over $300 million at the box office worldwide. A sequel to this movie was planned for 2016, but it never came out. The screenplay writer, Eric Brevig, said that he would not return to direct or write another script for the movie. He wanted to move onto other projects instead. A reboot of the series is currently in development with Tom Cruise playing the lead role. Another prequel will be released beforehand featuring Dracula himself. It will star Johnny Depp as Abraham van Helsing.
The first Van Helsing movie did not include any references to Dracula. However, a scene where Van Helsing goes into his coffin had been included in earlier drafts. That scene can now be seen in deleted scenes when watching the DVD version.
A video game adaptation of the same name was released in 2004. It featured most of the characters from the movies, including Van Helsing, Anna, Carl and Count Dracula. Some new characters were added such as Lucia Nix, who was voiced by Jennifer Carpenter. She later appeared in the TV show Dexter. The game itself got negative reviews because its graphics looked bad even though they used Unreal Engine 2.5. Many critics thought that the game should have been cancelled altogether. One critic called the game ""one of the worst games ever made"". Despite all the negativity towards it, some people still bought copies of the game. As of January 2017, there are only around 9000 units sold across Europe and North America combined according to VGChartz.com. A second game titled ""Dracula Origins"" was supposedly going to release sometime afterward but no details about what"

The cast includes Isla Fisher as Rebecca Bloomwood, Hugh Dancy as Luke Brandon, Joan Cusack as Suze Cleese, Krysten Ritter as Jane Bloomwood, John Goodman as Graham Bloomwood and Sarah Jessica Parker as Alette Naylor. The movie got negative reviews from critics. Box office wise it did well in North America but not so much overseas. Its budget was $35 million while its worldwide gross reached $78 million. This was more than the book's author Sophie Kinsella earned for writing the novel that inspired this film. In May 2014 there were talks about making a sequel to this movie. However no news came out since then. On January 6, 2017 Isla Fisher said she would be interested in returning to her role if the project ever happens. She also stated that fans have been asking her about this for years. On September 1, 2018 producer Jerry Bruckheimer confirmed he wanted to make another Shopaholic movie with Isla Fisher playing Rebecca again. He added that they are currently looking at writers who can do justice to the story. Nothing else has happened since then though. As of December 2020 there still isn't any information available regarding when or even whether the second Shopaholic movie will happen. It should be noted however that despite the fact that all these rumors keep popping up every few months none of them have actually resulted in anything happening yet. So don’t get your hopes too high unless you want to end up disappointed once again like many others before you. There might never be a sequel after all especially considering how long ago this first one came out back in early 2009 almost twelve years now!

He has played for FC Groningen, Feyenoord Rotterdam, Willem II Tilburg and SC Cambuur Leeuwarden in the Eredivisie. His last club as a professional was KV Mechelen from Belgium. After he stopped playing professionally he became assistant coach at Ajax Amsterdam under Louis van Gaal. When Van Gaal left to become national team trainer of Holland, Moniz took over his job. In 2003 Moniz moved abroad again becoming headcoach of VfL Wolfsburg in Germany. Since then he coached several clubs in Turkey, Greece and Poland. Currently he works in Portugal where he manages Famalicão. He also worked with FC Twente Enschede but he didn't stay very long because of bad results. On May 8th 2015 it was announced that Moniz would be the new manager of PEC Zwolle starting on July 1st after Dick Advocaat resigned earlier that day. It ended badly however since Zwolle had no points out of their first five matches. After two games they already had -7 goals difference and were placed bottom of the table. As a result Zwolle decided not to continue working together with Moniz anymore. They fired him and appointed care taker Kees van Wonderen who managed the team until the end of the season. The following year he went back to work for Portuguese side Famalicão which was still in the second division. This time it turned out better though; after one season he led them into the top flight. That same season he won promotion to Primeira Liga with Famalicao. During this period he got involved with an argument between two players during training when he tried to stop one of the players hitting another one. Both parties have accused each other of having started the fight. Despite being cleared by the court Moniz lost his job anyway. Since November 2019 he has been working for Polish Ekstraklasa club Lechia Gdańsk. At the beginning of January 2021 he returned to Portugal to manage Gil Vicente. However the relationship came to an abrupt ending just three months later. Since June 2021 he has been the manager of Azerbaijani Premier League club Sabail FK. In"

In July 2017 he was jailed for three months for unlawful assembly. On August 2018, Joshua Wong was sentenced again by a court to six more weeks jail term over his involvement in the 2014 Occupy Central movement. The sentence was seen as an attempt to silence him before major demonstrations against a proposed extradition bill that would allow people to be transferred into mainland China's judicial system. He was released after serving part of the time already spent under house arrest. A few days later he left Hong Kong for Germany via Taiwan due to fear of being arrested if he remained there. His departure led to large crowds gathering at airports across the city. Protesters also surrounded police headquarters calling for his release. He returned to Hong Kong on November 15th. Two days later, he resigned from Demosisto Party. After returning, he got detained for violating bail conditions. As a result, he received another two month prison sentence.

43,"### Human: What is the name and discovery date of asteroid 90?
 ### Assistant: 90 Antiope is a large Main belt asteroid. It was discovered by Annibale de Gasparis on October 12, 1865 in Naples. The S-type asteroid has an albedo of 0.34 and diameter of 178 km. Its rotation period has been calculated as 6.4 hours. It orbits at a distance of 2.5–3.0 AU once every 4 years (1,461 days; semi-major axis = 2.78 AU). Its orbital plane is inclined by 1° to the ecliptic. Asteroids with similar orbits include 6 Hebe, 12 Victoria, 106 Dione and 22 Kalliope. This group of asteroids are called ""Hygiea family"". They have different diameters but they orbit close together in space. These asteroids probably came from the collision of two larger parent bodies that broke apart into these smaller pieces. The most likely explanation for this collision is the giant impact hypothesis which explains how Earth's Moon formed. In this model, the proto-Earth collided with another planetary body about its size when it had just accreted. This would explain why Earth has only one moon while all other terrestrial planets have multiple moons. Since 90 Antiope has almost the same mass as our own moon, some astronomers think it could be part of this hypothetical moon of Earth. Other scientists believe there might still exist remnants of this ancient collision between Earth and another object somewhere within our Solar System today. If true then maybe we will find them sometime soon! 90 Antiope was named after one of Zeus' lovers who became Queen of Troy during Greek mythology times before Paris abducted her back home again later on down history lane.. Her story can also be found written inside Homer's epic poem known simply as 'The Iliad'. She married King Priam afterwards though not without first getting revenge against him too because he cheated on their marriage vows previously anyway so she killed herself instead out of grief over what happened next between those two people involved somehow along side each other simultaneously throughout time itself ever since then until now even more recently than ever before either way around wherever you look closely enough right here right now too since yesterday afternoon"
44,"### Human: What does particle size refer to?
 ### Assistant: Particle size is a measure of the size of particles. It can be used in chemistry, physics and other sciences. The measurement is usually given by a number followed by either cm or µm (micrometers). For example, if an object has a diameter of , then its particle size would be . In some cases it might also include units such as nm (nanometers), mm (millimeters) etc., but this depends on what kind of measurements are being made at that time. This article will focus mainly on how large something looks from our perspective; i.e., human eyesight vs microscope vision which gives us more detailed views into things like atoms/cells/bacteria etcetera. We'll use ""particles"" because they seem small enough for most people to understand them without having any trouble imagining their shape/size relationship with each other when compared side-by-side using traditional rulers. However there could still be confusion between two different types of sizes so let me clarify further below... When talking about particles we mean anything that can move around freely within space - whether solid liquid gas vapour dust sand gravel dirt mud clay soil rock water ice snow fog cloud air wind rain droplet mist spray smoke steam bubble foam sludge scum mucus spermatozoon egg yolk albumin globule cell nucleus chromosome mitochondria ribosome DNA RNA protein enzymes hormones neurotransmitters antibodies antigens immunoglobulins cytokines interleukins leptons quarks neutrinos bosons mesons photons electrons protons neutrons nuclei atoms molecules compounds mixtures alloys metals alloys semiconductors superconductors diamonds crystals glass ceramics plastics rubber wood coal charcoal graphite carbon nanotubes buckyballs fullerenes quantum dots quantum wells quantum wires quantum circuits superlattices laser diodes LEDs LCD displays flat panel TVs mobile phones tablets computers laptops netbooks notebooks smartphones cameras digital SLRs video camcorders binocular microscopes telescopes eyeglasses contact lenses hearing aid batteries solar cells fuel cells electrolysers hydrogen production plants bioreactors fermentation tanks inc"

 ### Assistant: Marzipan is a sweet food. It has ground almonds or other nuts, sugar, honey, and sometimes egg white as its main ingredients. In the United States of America, most people use it for making Christmas cookies. The word ""marzipan"" comes from German and means ""almond paste"". Other names are almendrados (Spanish), amandes (French) and mandelbrodt (Yiddish). There are different types of marzipan with different flavors such as chocolate-flavored marzipan, strawberry marzipan and pineapple marzipan. They can be eaten on their own, but they also have many uses. For example, they make great decorations for Christmas cake because they look like snowballs when you roll them into small balls before baking them. You could even add some sprinkles to give your creation an extra touch! This way everyone will know that this isn't just any old dessert - no sirree! These treats would definitely impress anyone who sees one at first glance due to all those beautiful colors combined together so well by Mother Nature herself...

 ### Assistant: The House of Slaves (or Casa das Escravas) was a place in Dakar, Senegal. It was used as a slave house from 1763 to 1848. It was on Gorée Island. It has been called ""the door of no return"". From this building, thousands of Africans were taken across the Atlantic Ocean by European traders during the Atlantic slave trade. Today, it is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site ""Goree Island - Slave Route"". In 2009, an African American actor visited the site. He said that he felt like his ancestors had come back to meet him at the point where they were last together before being sold into slavery. There are plans for the island's governor's residence to be made into a museum. This will tell about the history of the slave trade. A tourist guide there says that people feel sorrow when they visit the island. They know what happened here. Some people who have gone through this say that they want others not to go through it too. Others think that the past should stay in the past. People must focus on today and tomorrow. One man thinks that even though things happen, life goes on. Another person says that if you do bad things, you cannot expect good results. Bad actions cause bad results. But other people believe that everyone deserves forgiveness. We all make mistakes sometimes. Everyone needs help now and then. Even so, some people still ask why their relatives went through such terrible times because of someone else’s fault. No matter how much time passes, many questions remain unanswered. Maybe these places can give us answers sometime soon!
On March 5, 2017, French President François Hollande visited Goree Island with Barack Obama. Both men talked about the importance of remembering Africa's history.

53,"### Human: Who was the first Australian born explorer?
 ### Assistant: Charles Sturt (28 April 1795 – 16 June 1869) was an English-born Australian explorer. He is often called the ""father of inland Australia"". His expeditions were among the earliest to explore central parts of the continent, and stretched from southern Queensland into South Australia. Early life
Sturt was born at India House on 28 April 1795. He was the youngest child of a family with six children. At age seven he went to school for two years before being sent off to a naval training ship when his father died. When Sturt was thirteen, he started sailing around the world. In 1830, after visiting many places including North America and New Zealand, he sailed back home to England. After spending some time there, he decided that it would be better if he moved somewhere else because his wife had recently passed away and he didn't want to live alone anymore. Soon after this decision came about, John Macarthur offered him land near Sydney where they could start farming together as partners which led them both becoming wealthy over time until eventually settling down permanently within their own property known today as 'Burrangong'. This area became famous due its richness in gold deposits making it one place worth investing money into during those days when mining wasn’t so popular yet still provided enough income for people living nearby such places like Ballina or Mudgee who owned large tracts themselves but couldn't afford any more workers since prices weren't cheap either way!
Exploration career
In 1827, Governor Darling asked Lieutenant Colonel George Barney to find out what lay beyond the Blue Mountains west of Sydney. The expedition found only a few Aboriginal tribes living along rivers and creeks. They did not see any signs of European settlement. On returning to Sydney, Barney reported that nothing useful lay beyond these mountains; however, there may have been something further north towards Port Stephens or Hunter River Valley areas.
The next year saw another attempt by Major Thomas Mitchell under orders from Governor Bourke to explore the interior. Again no evidence of Europeans was discovered except for some old campsites left behind by earlier explorers such as Hamilton Hume and William Lawson. Mitchell returned disappointed having failed again despite going much farther than anyone else before him had done previously. It seemed unlikely anything would"

55,"### Human: What is the history and origin of Denial Bay?
 ### Assistant: Denial Bay is a small town in South Australia. It was established as a port for shipping wheat from the farms around it, but has now been abandoned by most people who live there. The town's name comes from its location on the coastline, which lies between Spencer Gulf to the north and Port Broughton to the south. It means ""no way out"" or ""nowhere else"". There are no roads connecting this area with other parts of the country; only one road leads into it—and that goes right through another city called Port Pirie (which also happens not be connected). In addition, because it isn't near any major cities like Adelaide or Melbourne (where many tourists visit), few visitors come here unless they have business at hand such as fishing boats going back home after being loaded up with cargo from nearby ports like Whyalla or Port Augusta where ships dock regularly throughout summer months when water levels drop low enough so that boats can safely pass under bridges without getting stuck inside them during high tides caused by stormy weather conditions outside sea level areas like Sydney Harbour where large cruise liners often moor while waiting patiently until their next destination arrives before departing again once all passengers disembarked onto land upon arrival time frame agreed prior departure date set forth earlier agreed upon terms & conditions listed within contract agreement signed off upon completion payment received accordingly per specified guidelines laid down previously stated above paragraph preceding these words written below line break point denoted herewithin textual context presented currently displayed screen viewable window space available displaying information contained herein current document page layout structure design format style sheet applied rules governing presentation formatting techniques utilized ensuring uniformity across entire user experience regardless operating system platform used accessing webpage accessed remotely located server farm hosting contents stored securely encrypted database managed servers maintained continuously updated regularly scheduled maintenance tasks performed periodically according predefined schedule determined based availability resources required maintain optimum performance levels expected users accessing site frequently visited frequently updated frequently revised frequently tested thoroughly debugged whenever needed troubleshooting issues identified resolved quickly efficiently effectively manner appropriate response times measured accurately recorded documented appropriately archived properly organized retrieved easily accessed conveniently searched promptly returned requested results immediately provided satisfactorily fulfilled expectations exceedingly satisfied customers delightedly pleased overall satisfaction rating awarded highest possible score achieved highest degree excellence deserved praises bestowed unanimous applause granted loudest cheers heard resounding echoes reverberated long"
56,"### Human: What are cannabinoids and how do they work?
 ### Assistant: Cannabinoids (from the Latin word for ""cannabis"") is a class of chemical compounds found in plants, animals and humans. They are similar to THC which occurs naturally in marijuana. The body makes some endocannabinoid molecules as neurotransmitters that bind to receptors on nerve cells throughout our bodies. These receptor sites are called CB1 or CB2 depending upon where they are located. Some people call these receptor sites “endocannabinoid system” because it has been shown that all mammals have this kind of networked communication system made up by these kinds of receptors. This system helps regulate many important functions like sleeping patterns, appetite control, immune response, memory retention etc.. When we consume foods containing certain types of fats such as Omega 3 fatty acids then those same endocannabinoids will be released into our bloodstream causing us feel hungry again! That's why when someone eats something greasy after going without any food at all he/she feels very full afterwards; however if one were not used to having much oil content within his diet then consuming too many calories could lead him towards becoming obese over time due mainly because there wasn’t enough insulin produced by pancreas during digestion process leading toward weight gain eventually resulting into metabolic syndrome type II diabetes later down road once more damage done already done beforehand even though person didn’t realize until now what happened earlier since effects weren’t felt immediately but rather took place gradually instead slowly accumulating over period months years decades centuries millennia ages epochs eras periods spans lifespans lifetimes generations timespan durations stretches gaps intervals moments instants seconds minutes hours days weeks months years decades centuries millennia ages epochs eras periods spans lifespans lifetimes generations timespan durations stretches gaps intervals moments instants seconds minutes hours days weeks months years decades centuries millennia ages epochs eras periods spans lifespans lifetimes generations timespan durations stretches gaps intervals moments instants seconds minutes hours days weeks months years decades centuries millennia ages epochs eras periods spans lifespans lifetimes generations timespan durations stretches gaps intervals moments instants"

 ### Assistant: Burgundy (Bourgogne in French) is a region of France. It borders the country of Belgium to its north, and Switzerland to it's east. The department is famous for producing wine from grapes grown on the sloping hillsides around Beaune and Dijon.  Burgundy was once an independent state, ruled by dukes who were also kings of France during part of their reign. They are known as ""Dukes of Burgundy"" or ""Counts of Burgundy"". During this time period Burgundy had many disputed territories with neighboring countries such as Flanders and Savoy which led them into war frequently throughout history until finally becoming united under one ruler again after being divided between two different families since 1477 when Charles II died without any children leaving him no heirs so his brother Louis XI inherited all land belonging previously owned by Charles I & Charles III but not including those areas held onto by other family members like Philip IV or Francis I due their own claims over parts within kingdom itself making things complicated further down line leading up towards eventual reunification sometime later down road somewhere near end 16th century mark where everything came together nicely enough before eventually falling apart again several centuries ago today thanks largely because lack proper maintenance caused problems arise resulting breakdown system overall effectiveness whole entire structure left standing nowadays barely recognizable remains only shadow former glory days gone past forevermore never be seen again unless somehow revived somehow someway maybe through use technology rebuild piece-by-piece bringing back life long forgotten dreams lost ages ago buried deep beneath layers dirt dust decay rotten wood crumbling bricks broken glass shattered windows splintered boards cracked walls chipped floors torn curtains tattered carpets ripped upholstery stained ceilings peeling paint faded colors rusty nails missing screws creaking hinges sagging roof leaks dripping water mold growing fungus spreading bacteria eating away at very core foundation itself slowly eroding away bit-by-bit day-after-day week-after-week month-after-month year-after-year decade-after-decade century-after-century millennial milestone surpassed exceed expectations reach beyond limits thought possible seemingly impossible feat achieved accomplishment made reality tangible thing solid object physical manifestation"
59,"### Human: What is the release date and discontinuation date of the Nokia 7650?
 ### Assistant: The Nokia 7650 was released on August 1, 2002. It had a 3-inch color screen with a resolution of 80x48 pixels (QVGA). It could be used as a digital camera phone because it has an internal camera that can take pictures in 640×480 or 352×288 pixel quality. A version without this feature called the Nokia 7610 was also made for people who did not want to pay extra money for the camera. Discontinued by Nokia since March 2004. This model was replaced by Nokia 9210i. The Nokia 7650 does have Bluetooth built into it but lacks infrared connectivity which would allow one device to communicate with another. Other features include an FM radio and MP3 player. Some models of this phone are sold under other names such as Siemens SL55. It is possible to upgrade the software inside these phones using a special cable from your computer's USB port. The phone uses GPRS technology so you will need data services if you plan to use its internet capabilities. In some countries where GSM networks do not support UMTS yet, users may still purchase them because they work just fine over EDGE instead! If there isn’t any signal at all then it should automatically switch back down again until reception returns properly - something very useful when traveling abroad especially when roaming charges apply each month based upon usage amount rather than time spent talking/texting etcetera.. This means even though calls might cost more per minute while out of range compared against local rates within coverage area(s), overall bill amounts shouldn't exceed what we paid before leaving home country unless making international long distance calls too often throughout day/week period(s) resulting increased usage fees accordingly depending how much talk occurred during said span(s). There are two ways of getting free apps onto your mobile device – either through downloading directly via WiFi connection OR connecting wirelessly through BlueTooth technology available almost everywhere nowadays including homes offices schools hospitals shopping malls airports bus stations train depots taxicabs limousines shuttles ferries cruise ships hotels motels resorts restaurants cafes bars clubs nightclubs discos lounges pubs taverns grills diners"

He served as Mayor of the town of Châteaulin, Finistère from 1978 to 2006 and again from 2014 until his death in 2021. He also served as President of the General Council of Finistère between 1982 and 2011. Raynaud died on 25 September 2021 at the age of 87. His cause of death has not been revealed yet. However, it is known that he had contracted COVID-19 before dying. A few days earlier, another mayor, Émile Saliou, had died after testing positive for COVID-19 during the pandemic. The two were close friends. As such, many people believe they both might have caught COVID-19 while attending an event together. It remains unknown if this could be true or just coincidental. This would mean that the virus spreads easily among older people with underlying health conditions.

On May 7th, 2020, both men were sentenced to life imprisonment without parole after being found guilty of running one of history’s largest cocaine cartels. They would have faced up to three decades behind bars if convicted on all counts but avoided additional time because their lawyers argued against the charges. On September 29th, 2020, Gilberto Rodriguez died from natural causes while serving his sentence. At the age of 75. The cause of death is still unknown. However, many speculate that it might be due to complications caused by COVID-19 or another illness such as cancer which can occur when someone reaches this advanced stage in life. It should not come as much surprise considering how old these people get before passing away peacefully in their sleep rather than dying suddenly like some other famous criminals did during their lifetime including Pablo Escobar who passed away just five months earlier than him back in June 1993 due to heart failure brought about by stress related issues stemming from living under constant surveillance from authorities until finally giving himself over voluntarily into custody where he spent eight years locked inside solitary confinement awaiting trial only then getting released early thanks largely due having contracted tuberculosis shortly thereafter leading directly towards full recovery within days; however despite receiving proper medical treatment throughout entire period still ended up succumbing prematurely anyway simply because nature had already taken its course leaving no room left open for any sort miraculous comeback story line scenario ever again possible down here below ground level reality checks waiting patiently outside doorways each morning ready welcome everyone new arrival eager learn secrets success stories past failures alike hoping somehow manage overcome obstacles standing between them dream becoming true eventually"
68,"### Human: What is Ashland?
 ### Assistant: Ashland is a city in Boyd County, Kentucky. It was first called Poage's Landing and then became known as Carter Cantonment. The name of the town changed to Ashland when it received its post office on July 25, 1860. There are many things named after Henry Clay such as Ashland High School (which has since closed) and the Ashland Oil Company which started with one oil well drilled by Henry Clay. Ashland also had an amusement park from 1907 until 1934 that featured rides like roller coasters. In recent years there have been talks about building another amusement park but nothing has happened yet. A new airport opened for business near Ashland in March 2014. It will replace the old airport that used to be at the site where the proposed new amusement park would go if built someday soon or later down the road not too far away either way really though because both places aren’t very different distances apart anyway so you could say they’re close enough together even though technically speaking they aren’t actually right next door neighbors but still pretty close nonetheless considering how small towns tend to be around here anyway so who knows maybe sometime soon we might see some changes happen here too just like what happened over there back then before everything got all settled down again once more thanks largely due mostly mainly almost entirely completely solely totally wholly fully altogether exclusively uniquely distinctively individually specially separately privately independently uncommonly rarely seldom scarcely infrequently hardly exceptionally scarce rare unusual odd strange bizarre weird out-of-the ordinary unique peculiar eccentric curious novel singular extraordinary special uncommon individual exclusive private independent uncommon hard hardy sturdy strong tough solid firm steady resolute reliable stable enduring immovable secure permanent unshakable steadfast fixed set rigid fastened immutable certain sure positive assured safe sound tight dependable trustworthy constant eternal everlasting perpetual long lasting durable indestructible forevermore timeless boundless without limits never ending always present unchanging undying immortal ageless ancient classic vintage antique historical traditional heritage conventional customary typical orthodox mainstream accepted standard commonplace normal average usual run-of-the mill everyday regular routine mundane prosaic quotidian ho-hum workaday hum"

 ### Assistant: Virginia Fox (born Violet Mildred Robinson; January 23, 1895 – September 14, 1980) was an American actress. She appeared in many silent movies and worked for D. W. Griffith's company. Her best known role is as the heroine of The Birth of a Nation. In later years she acted mostly on stage. Fox died from heart failure at her home in Los Angeles, California on September 14, 1980. She was 85 years old. At that time she had been married to actor Jack Pickford since 1927 until his death in 1936. They did not have any children together but they adopted two girls during their marriage. One of them is Mary Pickford who became an Academy Award winning movie star herself. After Pickford's death Fox never remarried or dated anyone else before dying alone without issue almost forty four years after him being gone too early due to alcoholism related problems like cirrhosis which led up to his demise back then when he passed away unexpectedly much younger than expected because he drank heavily most nights even though it wasn't often enough where someone would notice anything different about how drunk off their face this person looked compared with other times throughout life so far - especially considering there were no signs showing otherwise besides maybe some slight slurring here-and-there depending upon level reached prior day(s). So overall speaking nothing really stood out against others around same age range except perhaps occasional blackouts caused by excessive drinking habits leading towards addiction issues down road ahead if left unchecked over period longer term basis...
So basically just trying avoid getting caught up within cycle repeating itself again next year comes along only makes things worse instead better situationally wise outcome possible given circumstances involved nowadays.

 ### Assistant: Sir Theodore Wilson Harris (25 August 1930 – 14 October 2017) was a British-born Guyanese historian, writer and politician. He served as the Ambassador of Guyana to India from 1986 until his retirement in 1992. He also served as Chairman of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM). He was born in Georgetown, British Guiana. Harris died on 14 October 2017 at the age of 87. His cause of death has not been revealed yet. Harris is survived by two sons and one daughter. One son is an American citizen who lives in New York City while another son lives in London. Both are married with children. A third child, a girl, is single but living abroad. All three children have university degrees and professional careers outside their country of origin. They all speak English fluently though they grew up speaking Creole or French Creole languages first before learning English later when attending school where it became compulsory for everyone regardless if they spoke any other language besides English already so there would be no confusion between what people were saying since most schools taught only one official language which made communication easier among students even though many times some had trouble understanding others because each person's dialect differed slightly depending upon where he/she lived within that region (i.,e., rural vs urban areas). As well as being able to communicate effectively amongst themselves using this common tongue; these youngsters could still understand other dialects spoken throughout various parts across our globe without much difficulty either way around thanks again mainly due mostly just simply having access readily available online today through computers connected via internet connections worldwide everywhere else too!

71,"### Human: What was SummerSlam (2016)?
 ### Assistant: SummerSlam (2016) is a professional wrestling pay-per-view show made by WWE. It will be held on August 21, 2016 at Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York City. It is the thirtieth SummerSlam event produced by WWE. There are eleven matches scheduled for this event. This includes one match that has been signed but not officially announced yet. The main event features Brock Lesnar defending his Universal Championship against Randy Orton and Dean Ambrose in a Triple Threat match. Another featured bout sees Finn Bálor defend the WWE World Heavyweight Championship against Seth Rollins. Other matches include Roman Reigns versus Rusev, AJ Styles vs John Cena for the United States Championship, Charlotte Flair vs Sasha Banks for the Raw Women's Championship and Dolph Ziggler facing The Miz. This will also feature the final of the 2016 WWE Draft. In July 2015, it was reported that SummerSlam would take place at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York. Tickets went on sale June 3, 2016. On April 4, 2016, WWE confirmed that the event had sold out. The pre-show started at 7 p.m. ET with the kickoff show starting at 8 p.m. ET on the WWE Network. After being moved to the arena due to high demand, tickets were sold out within two hours after going on sale. The event drew an attendance of 19,100 people. It grossed $2 million in ticket sales. The event received mixed reviews from critics. Many praised the card as well as some of the booking decisions while others criticized the lackluster crowd response during certain moments such as the main event. However, most agreed that the event wasn't able to live up to its hype. Overall, the event was rated three stars out of five by Dave Meltzer of the Wrestling Observer Newsletter.
 
This marked the first time since WrestleMania XXVII that all four of WWE's active championships changed hands. It was also the second year where every championship was won by someone other than their previous holder; only the Intercont"
72,"### Human: Who was King of England from 8 June 1042 AD to 4 January 1066?
 ### Assistant: Edward the Confessor (c. 1003 – 5 January 1066) was King of England from 8 June 1042 until his death in 1066. He is usually numbered as King Edward I, but he wasn't actually called that during his life and after it there were two more kings named Edward so historians call him ""Edward the Confessor"" instead. In Old English a king would be known by what they had done for their kingdom rather than just being given a name like we do today. This means that when people talk about Edward the Confessor or King Alfred they are talking about different things because each person has been given their own title based on something specific they did while alive. It also helps us know which one we mean if we don't say anything else! The word 'confessor' refers to someone who confesses Christianity publicly and privately through words or actions without fearing persecution; this could include martyrdom where someone dies defending themselves against those trying to kill them simply because they believe differently than everyone else does at home base camp headquarters office building temple church synagogue mosque etcetera..

He played as midfielder for Warta Poznań, Legia Warsaw, Arminia Bielefeld, Alemannia Aachen and KS Cracovia. As manager he coached the national team of Poland from July to August 1985. In total, he made eleven appearances for the Polish national side between 1968 and 1973, scoring one goal. His son Tomasz is also a footballer. He died on 20 September 2017 in Poznań at the age of 71. The cause of death has not been announced yet. However, it was confirmed that his health had deteriorated after a long battle with cancer. He will be buried on Friday, 22 September 2017 at the cemetery in Radojewo near Gniezno. On Thursday evening, there were several minutes of silence during the game against Austria. Afterwards, fans showed their respect by singing ""We are the famous Lech's"" while holding up white cards with Grudzień's name written on them. During the match, players wore black armbands as a sign of mourning. They later held up a large banner which read: ""For you we play, we miss you"". The stadium itself was lit in red colour. It was followed by an applause. Many other clubs paid tribute to him including Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich. Grzegorz Lato wrote on Twitter: ""He was my friend, great athlete and even greater person."" Zdzisław Krzywiński said: ""It was very difficult news when I heard about it today. We spent many years together playing football. I remember our time together well. He helped me become better than before. He always wanted to win no matter what. And he did so because he loved this sport. That was why he became such a good player. Our thoughts go out to all who knew him. May God rest his soul. My condolences to his family. I hope they find strength to overcome this sadness."" Former president Aleksander Kwaśniewski added: ""I am deeply sorry to hear about his passing away. He was truly legend"
74,"### Human: Who is the god of water and the sea in ancient Roman religion and mythology?
 ### Assistant: Neptune (Latin: ) was the god of water and the sea, freshwater springs, rivers, lakes and rain. He was also a god of horses. His name comes from a Latin word for water, which came from Greek ""Νεπτύνη"" meaning ""the wet one"". In ancient Roman religion and mythology, he is the brother of Jupiter and Pluto. With Poseidon, he ruled over earthquakes.  The cult of Neptune was established by Rome's second king Numa Pompilius around 715 BC. On 23 July each year, there were festivals held at his temple on the Campus Martius to honour him. These included horse races and other games and events. A major festival in honor of Neptune was celebrated every four years during the Secular Games. The celebration lasted five days. It began with a procession through the streets of Rome. There were chariot races and athletic contests along with religious ceremonies. Many people who attended the event had their names recorded so that they could receive special honors later. This festival continued until about AD 400 when it became too expensive to run. Other temples dedicated to Neptune are known throughout Italy and in Africa, but none survive today. Some scholars believe that many Roman cities may have been named after this deity because most of them contain some form of ""-nus"" or ""-na"", such as Aquae Sulis (""Waters of Sul"") near Bath, England; Portus Salonis (""Port of Soli"") on Cyprus; Antium Novum (""New Ancient Town""); and Portus Julius (""Julian Harbor""). Others think these towns might be related to Janus instead since both gods share similar attributes like being guardians against evil spirits while protecting travelers from harmful creatures lurking beneath dark waters where no light can penetrate deep down below ground level where monsters live hidden away waiting patiently until prey ventures close enough before springing out suddenly catching unsuspecting victims unaware leaving little time left alive unless someone else intervenes quickly rescuing anyone caught off-guard unprepared defenseless unable defend themselves effectively retaliate aggressively fight back hard enough win victory triumphantly emerge unscathed unharmed intact whole healthy sound safe secure protected saved res"
75,"### Human: Who is Booker T. Jones?
 ### Assistant: Booker Taliaferro ""Booker T."" Jones (born November 12, 1944) is an American musician and record producer. He was born in Memphis, Tennessee. He played organ for the band Booker T. & The MG's from 1962 to 1970. They recorded many hit songs such as ""Green Onions"" and ""Time Is Tight"". After he left that group, he became a session keyboardist and worked with other musicians including Otis Redding. In 1985, his solo album Potato Hole won him two Grammy Awards. Since then, he has continued recording albums both by himself and also with groups like The Roots or The Blind Boys of Alabama. His most recent work includes the soundtrack to the movie Soul Men (2008). In 2007, Jones performed at the Bonnaroo Music Festival. It was one of the last performances given by guitar player Steve Cropper before he retired. In January 2013, he released Sound the Alarm which included guest artists such as Justin Timberlake and Sharon Jones. This album reached number four on Billboard magazine's R&B/Soul Albums chart. In September 2013, he appeared at the iTunes Festival in London. He later toured Europe in October 2013 where he visited cities such as Amsterdam, Berlin, Paris and Milan. In February 2014, he began touring North America again with stops scheduled throughout April 2014. At this time it looks like there are no plans yet announced for any more concert tours after that date though new dates may be added if needed due to demand or changes made by promoters. Jones currently lives near Nashville but spends much of each year traveling around giving live shows all over the world.
In July 2014, he will perform at several festivals across England including Glastonbury Festival and Latitude Festival among others. He continues to play keyboards professionally even though he does not have formal training beyond high school level courses taken years ago when he first started learning how to use instruments properly without having any help from teachers who could show him what notes were being used correctly during practice sessions back home while growing up listening only to classical pieces composed centuries earlier than today’s modern soundscape created through technology advancements"

 ### Assistant: Ronald Erwin McNair (October 21, 1950 – January 28, 1986) was an American physicist and astronaut. He flew on STS-41B in February 1984 as a mission specialist. In 1986 he died during the launch of Space Shuttle Challenger. The spacecraft exploded after liftoff because of problems with its boosters. All seven crew members were killed including Christa McAuliffe who would have been the first teacher to go into space if they had not crashed. A crater on Mars is named for him. His brother Carl McNair became a NASA engineer. On June 3, 2017, the McNairs' childhood home at 104 South Street in Lake City, South Carolina was designated as his birthplace by the National Park Service under the National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom Program. It is now part of the Dr. Ronald E. McNair Life History Center. This museum tells about his life and honors his legacy. There are also exhibits that tell about other African Americans who made history. These include Harriet Tubman, Jackie Robinson and Martin Luther King Jr.. President Barack Obama came here on July 21, 2017 to help celebrate this designation. The house has been restored since then. It looks like it did when he lived there. An annual festival called ""The Summer of '86"" takes place every year around the time of his death. Events take place all over town from late December through early January. They remember what happened to him and others who lost their lives in the Challenger disaster. The events include art shows, concerts, plays, lectures and sporting competitions. People come together to talk about how far society has come since then. For example, there are more women, people of color and LGBTQ+ individuals working in STEM fields than before. However, many feel that much still needs to be done so these groups can reach their full potential. Other activities include building robots or making science projects for school fairs. Sometimes students present them in front of judges who decide which ones get prizes based on things like creativity and originality. Also, some schools hold essay contests where children write stories related to topics such as"
77,"### Human: What is taurine and where does it come from?
 ### Assistant: Taurine (2-aminoethanesulfonic acid) is an amino sulfonic acid. It was first discovered in bulls' eyes, hence its name. It has the chemical formula C₂H7NO₃S. It is a white crystalline solid that can be made by oxidizing ethylene glycol with nitric acid or reacting 2-oxoethanol with hydrogen peroxide. About half of all mammals make their own taurine; others get it through food. The body makes taurine for many reasons. For example, taurine helps form bile acids which help digest fats. Taurine also plays a role in brain development during pregnancy. In humans, there are only small amounts of free taurine in the bloodstream. Most of the human body’s supply comes from dietary intake of animal protein containing cysteine and methionine. Taurine is found mainly in meat products such as poultry, fish, seafood, eggs and dairy products. Some vegetable sources include soy milk and tofu. There have been some studies about possible health benefits of taking supplemental taurine but they were not conclusive. One study showed that people who took extra taurine had better cognitive function than those who did not take it. Another study suggested that taurine might protect against heart disease because it lowers cholesterol levels and improves arterial elasticity while reducing inflammation markers like C reactive protein (CRP). However these findings need further research before we know if this is true or not.
Taking too much taurine could cause nausea, vomiting, constipation and diarrhea. People should talk to their doctor before starting any new supplement regimen including taurine supplements since dosages vary depending on age group and weight among other things. Pregnant women may want to avoid using high doses of taurine due to lack of safety data available at present time regarding use during pregnancy/breastfeeding period. Children under 18 years old should consult pediatricians prior usage due risk associated with potential side effects related kidney stones formation after prolonged exposure periods exceeding recommended daily allowances set forth FDA guidelines governing safe consumption limits determined based upon individual toler"

 ### Assistant: Sardasht (; ) is a city in West Azerbaijan Province, Iran. It is the capital of Sardasht County. At the 2016 census, its population was 45,397. The city had been known as ""Sar Dasht"" until it changed to Sardasht on June 8, 1980 after experiencing a devastating poison gas attack by Iraqi forces during the Iran–Iraq War. In March 1988, Iraq launched another chemical weapons strike against the town and several other Kurdish cities across the border. About two hundred people were killed and thousands more injured or made ill from exposure to mustard gas or nerve agents. Most of those who died are buried in mass graves at the cemetery outside the town. Many survivors continue to suffer health problems caused by their exposure to these gases. On August 28, 2003, an earthquake measuring 6.0 on the Richter scale hit the area around Sardasht. No casualties were reported but there was extensive damage to property and infrastructure. After the quake, many residents left the region permanently because they feared future tremors. There has not been any significant seismic activity since then, however. Sardasht is located near the western end of Lake Urmia, which supplies water for agricultural use throughout the province. Agriculture is the main industry in the surrounding areas with wheat being grown extensively. The weather here can be harshly cold during winters due to low temperatures combined with heavy snowfall. Summers tend to be hot and dry although occasional rains do occur between July and September each year. Sardasht experiences moderate levels of precipitation annually averaging about . Rainfall occurs mostly during springtime when thunderstorms develop over the mountains nearby before moving down into lower elevations towards towns like this one where most rain falls through May/June followed closely by October/November before tapering off completely afterwards until early February next season starts again! People living close enough will get some amount every month while others may only see occasional showers depending upon how far away you live from them. Snow usually melts quickly once warmth returns allowing crops such as rice or maize to grow well without too much trouble provided adequate irrig"

Snow is survived by two daughters and three sons. One of his sons, Craig, is currently manager of Conference North side Matlock Town F.C.. The club held a minute's silence before their match against Ashton United to honour him. Another one of his sons, Mark, plays for Northern Premier Division side Stocksbridge Park Steels. A third son, David, has been capped at international level playing wheelchair football. A fourth son, Darren, is also involved in football coaching. Ken Snow also had four grandchildren named Kieran, Daniel, Leah & Lewis. They are all very close to each other even though they live far away from each other nowadays. They are all still young so it may be some time until any more children will come along but if there were then it would probably be another boy called Liam or something similar like that because none of them have names starting with L yet except for Lewis who just happens to start with L anyway which makes it a little bit different than the others having no name starting with L up till this point! However when they get older maybe they might want to change their names around depending upon what kind of personality traits they develop throughout life itself too!.
 
Snow started out playing junior football in the East Midlands for Newstead Colliery Welfare, Sutton Bonington Boys Club and Hucknall Athletic. After moving into senior football with Staveley Miners Welfare in 1954, he joined Mansfield Town, where he spent three years without scoring a goal in eighty league games. In October 1957, he signed for First Division club Nottingham Forest. Despite being a regular player during his first season at the City Ground, he made only seven further appearances in"

86,"### Human: Who was Galileo Galilei and what is he most remembered for?
 ### Assistant: Galileo Galilei (15 February 1564 – 8 January 1642) was an Italian physicist, mathematician, astronomer, and philosopher who lived during the Renaissance. He is best known for his work in observational astronomy. Using a telescope that he had built himself, Galileo discovered four moons of Jupiter, phases of Venus, sunspots on the Sun, and mountains on the Moon. His observations are sometimes said to have been responsible for convincing people that the Earth revolved around the Sun instead of vice versa. In 1970, Pope Paul VI declared him blessed by saying ""Blessed be your name"". This means he is not considered a saint but has some special honor from God. The Catholic Church believes that if one prays to Galileo they will get their request granted because he was so good at science. However this belief is controversial since there is no proof that it works or even exists as a religion like Christianity does today with its own set of rules about how we should live our lives according to them.""
 
Galileo's father Vincenzo died when Galileo was eight years old. When he was eleven, he moved away from home to study under the tutelage of Jacopo Borghini. Later on in life, while working at Pisa University where he taught mathematics, physics & philosophy; after being fired due to heresy charges brought against him by Dominican monks over his writings which contradicted Aristotle's teachings concerning gravity - something that would later become accepted theory through Isaac Newton’s discovery of universal gravitation law! While studying medicine at Sienna University near Rome, Italy he became interested in astronomical phenomena such as comets appearing every few hundred years before disappearing again into space forevermore until next time around when another celestial body enters orbit around earth once more...

 ### Assistant: Dalby Forest is a forest in the North York Moors National Park, North Yorkshire, England. It covers 30 square miles (78 km2). The name of the village and post town next to it are also called ""Dalby"". In total there are three villages named Dalby within five miles from each other; Dalby near Pickering, Dalby on the A169 road between Kirkbymoorside and Scarborough, and Great Dalby. The main attraction at the forest is Go Ape! which includes zip wires over two lakes. There is also an adventure playground called Funky Monkeys. On the north side of the forest, about half way along is Hutton-le-Hole. This small settlement has many buildings dating back hundreds of years. The most notable building is St Michael's Church, built in Norman times. At the top end of the forest is Sneaton Castle Hotel. Built as a private house by Lord Gerard in the late nineteenth century, the castle was used during World War II as a hospital for injured soldiers. After this it became a hotel. Nowadays it operates as both a wedding venue and a conference centre. About one mile south west of the castle is Sneaton Thorp railway station. This is on the Esk Valley Line. This runs between Middlesbrough and Whitby with stops including Nunthorpe, Guisborough and Loftus. Also nearby is the market town of Malton where people can buy local produce such as pork pies and strawberries. Dalby is just off the A169 between Pickering and Malton. Both towns have train stations served by Northern Trains services from York and Scarborough respectively. From the A169, turn onto the B1257 towards Dalby. Then follow signs for the visitor centre. If travelling by public transport, take the bus service number 40 or 41 from Malton Bus Station. These run every hour Monday - Saturday. They stop outside the Visitor Centre. For those coming from further afield, Yorkshire Coastliner services X93/X94 operate through the area. These go via Filey, Scarborough, Seamer, Malton and Thirsk.

 ### Assistant: A sachet d'épices (sack of spices) or herbes de Provence is a mixture of dried savory herbs from the Mediterranean region. It can be found in France, Italy, Greece, Turkey, Morocco, Lebanon and Egypt. The name means ""bag of spices"" but does not usually contain any actual spice. The ingredients are ground up to powder before being mixed together with other seasonings such as salt, pepper or garlic cloves. They are often put into pouches made out of fabric so that they do not get lost when cooking food at home; however some people prefer using plastic bags because these tend to last longer than cloth ones would if left unused for long periods time after purchase due to their lack durability over time which makes them more likely break down faster than other materials might otherwise allow us too!

89,"### Human: Who was Idanell Brill Connally?
 ### Assistant: Idanell Brill Connally (June 28, 1930 – April 6, 2021) was an American politician and businesswoman. She was the First Lady of Texas from January 15, 1963 to November 22, 1963 during her husband John F. Kennedy's presidency. Her term ended after his assassination in Dallas on that day. The couple had been married for less than a year at this point. They were childless before he died. Afterward she remarried and became known as Nellie Connally. She served as president of the Texas A&M University System Board of Regents from 1974 until 1979. In 1986 she was elected chairperson of the board and held that position through 1993. She also served two terms on the Texas Railroad Commission, which regulates oil and gas production. She was born in Austin, Texas. Connally died on April 6, 2021 in Houston, aged 90. No cause or location has been revealed. She is buried next to her first husband in Arlington National Cemetery. At the time of her death she was one of only three surviving widows of U.S. Presidents. The other two are Patricia Nixon and Betty Ford. Former First Ladies Rosalynn Carter, Nancy Reagan and Barbara Bush have all outlived their husbands. Connally was the last living former First Lady who did not serve as either President or Vice-President themselves. She was preceded in death by Bess Truman, Mamie Eisenhower, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, Lady Bird Johnson, Betty Ford and Elizabeth Dole. She was succeeded by Jo Ann Daniels, wife of George W. Bush, the 43rd President. Mrs. Connally herself was predeceased by Laura Bush, wife of George H.W. Bush, the 41st President. Hillary Clinton, wife of Bill Clinton, the 42nd President, was still alive when Connally died but never served as First Lady. Neither did Melania Trump, wife of Donald J. Trump, the current President. This makes Connally the most recent living person with any connection to the office of the United States presidency."

92,"### Human: What is a bistro and what kind of food do they serve?
 ### Assistant: A bistro (pronounced [bistʁo]) is a small restaurant that serves moderately priced simple meals. The word comes from the French ""brasserie"" which means tavern or bar, though in English it can mean any sort of informal eating place with table service. Bistros are often found near universities, serving students who want to eat at reasonable prices. They usually offer wine by the glass. In France, many bistros have become popular tourist attractions because of their traditional cuisine. Some famous examples include Le Procope in Paris' Latin Quarter. Other well-known bistros around Europe include the Barberini in Rome and the Maison Dorée in Brussels. There was once one called La Coupole on Montparnasse Boulevard in Paris but this closed down some years ago. It had been open for nearly 100 years before its closure. Many people were saddened when it shut as it used to be an important meeting place for writers, artists and other members of Parisian society. Nowadays there are not so many bistros left but those that remain still attract customers eager to enjoy good home cooking without spending too much money. Most bistros nowadays also sell coffee drinks such as espressos and cappuccinos along with hot chocolate or tea if desired by patrons visiting them during lunchtime hours only - since these places tend not stay open after dark unless perhaps someone wants something sweet like ice cream sundaes! 
Bistros typically specialize in classic dishes made using fresh ingredients sourced locally whenever possible; although sometimes imported items may appear depending upon availability within each region where particular restaurants operate out of – including cheeses & wines etcetera... .

 ### Assistant: Jennie Trinidad Fernando Kwan (born 1974) is an American lawyer and politician. She was the United States Attorney for the Northern District of California from May 2013 to January 20, 2021 during the Obama administration. Before that she worked as a federal prosecutor in San Francisco, California. In November 2020, Joe Biden nominated her again as U.S. attorney but this time for a four-year term. Her nomination expired on January 20, 2021 when Kamala Harris left office after being elected Vice President of the United States. On February 8, 2021, it was announced by White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki that Biden would nominate Stephanie Hinds as interim U.S. attorney until his permanent replacement could be named. Hinds assumed the role at noon Eastern Standard Time on March 6, 2021. She will serve in the position until June 30, 2021. Afterwards, David Anderson Jr., who had been serving as acting U.S. Attorney since then, became the official appointee. The Senate confirmed him on October 5, 2021. He took office later that day. Kwan returned to private practice with Morrison & Foerster. At age thirty nine, Kwan was one of the youngest ever appointed U.S. Attorneys nationwide. She has said that she wanted to be a police officer growing up. However, she changed her mind because ""I didn’t think I looked like a cop."" She received both her bachelor's degree and law degree from Stanford University. She also studied abroad in France. During college, she interned at the Supreme Court of the United States. While there, she met Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Later, while working as a clerk, Kwan met Judge Alex Kozinksi. They have remained friends ever since.

94,"### Human: Who was Séamus Patrick Pattison?
 ### Assistant: Séamus Patrick Pattison (12 October 1936 – 7 December 2020) was an Irish priest of the Roman Catholic Church. He became a priest in 1968 and served as Bishop of Ossory from 1995 to 2014. He also worked at St Mary's College, Twickenham, London. From 2014 until his death he was Titular Bishop of Vagada and Apostolic Administrator Emeritus of Ossory. Pattison died on 7 December 2020 in Kilkenny at the age of 84. His cause for canonization has begun. The process is underway since April 2021. On 3 July 2022 Pope Francis approved the decree that allowed him to be called ""Venerable"". This means that the next step would be beatification if there are miracles attributed to him after he dies. He had been suffering from cancer prior to his death. In August 2022 it was revealed that Pattison had sexually abused minors while serving as a parish priest between 1971-1973. A report by Ireland's National Board for Safeguarding Children said he admitted to being guilty of sexual misconduct with two boys aged eight and nine years old. It happened during swimming lessons where he rubbed their genital areas before asking them to massage his groin area. He denied any wrongdoing but accepted he should have reported this behaviour to someone else. At least one victim came forward with allegations against Pattison. One person accused him of having oral sex with him when they were children; another claimed that Pattison made him touch himself while giving him a blessing. Both cases occurred between 1971–1973. After these incidents, he moved back home because he felt uncomfortable around other people due to feeling ashamed about what had happened. There were no further reports involving Pattison until September 2017 when new accusations surfaced claiming that he engaged in multiple acts of child molestation over several years starting in 1971. These claims led authorities to investigate whether there might have been additional victims who did not come forward earlier. However, none of those investigated confirmed anything beyond rumours surrounding P"
95,"### Human: What happens to the body during starvation?
 ### Assistant: Starvation is a lack of food. The word comes from an Old English term, steorfan, which meant ""die of hunger"". People who do not eat enough die of malnutrition or starve to death. When people have little food for a long time their bodies break down and they become weak. They may also lose weight because muscles are used as fuel when there isn't much energy in their diet. If someone doesn’t get any nutrients at all then organs start shutting down one by one until eventually you can no longer live without them functioning properly so it would be best if you got some kind of help before this point arrives since otherwise death will follow shortly afterward due to organ failure caused by too many days spent without eating anything substantial enough to sustain life itself let alone keep going strong against other problems such as illness etcetera… A person with severe malnourishment needs medical attention immediately; however those suffering mild forms might benefit more greatly from being given vitamins instead while waiting on proper treatment options becoming available again soon afterwards once things settle back into place naturally over time passing slowly but surely forward towards recovery instead where possible before anything else bad happens along similar lines later down road ahead here today tomorrow morning next weekend sometime later maybe even sooner than expected depending upon how quickly certain conditions change course overall direction taken throughout entire duration involved here now currently right now presently speaking specifically about topic discussed above paragraph below section following sentence preceding line written above two words spoken just prior moment ago earlier yesterday evening last night tonight early morning hours coming up very soon within few short minutes away near future close proximity around corner nearby vicinity surrounding area surrounding neighborhood encompassing region encircling space containing territory comprising landmass including continent spanning planet Earth inhabiting universe expanding rapidly beyond limits previously thought unimaginable impossibilities exceeding expectations far surpassing limitations stretching boundaries pushing frontiers reaching new heights climbing higher peaks scaling greater mountains conquering impossible feats achieving amazing victories accomplishing incredible goals succeeding spectacularly triumphant success stories winning huge trophies gaining tremendous rewards receiving enormous prizes earning gigantic bonuses getting massive payoffs scoring colossal profits making astronomical gains taking monstrous leaps landing epic jumps pulling off legendary moves completing astonishing tasks finishing remarkable jobs doing outstanding work performing awesome de"

97,"### Human: What is the chemical formula and properties of bismuthine?
 ### Assistant: Bismuthine, also known as bis(bismuthide), is a chemical compound. It contains bismuth in its +3 oxidation state. Its chemical formula is Bi2+2. Properties 
Bismuthine can be made by reacting potassium with bismuth or anhydrous hydrogen fluoride. The product looks like black powder. This substance does not dissolve easily in water but it will dissolve in aqua regia (nitric acid mixed with hydrochloric acid). When heated to high temperatures, this compound becomes brownish-black. This happens because some of the bismuth turns into metallic bismuth. Heating bismuthine produces bismuth trioxide when oxygen is present. It makes bismuth subcarbonate if carbon dioxide is added. Adding sulfur to bismuthine forms thiobis(bismuthide) which has no color. Other reactions that form this material include reducing salts such as sodium nitrate using aluminum metal and then adding concentrated hydrochloric acid. Another way is to add iodide ion to solutions containing bismuth salt. Some other ways are to use a solution of ammonia, silver chloride, hydroiodic acid, potassium iodate, or lead acetate followed by boiling for about five minutes. These methods do work better than just putting bismuth in hot water since they make sure all the bismuth goes through them instead of staying inside one part where you don't want it to go. You should always wear safety goggles when handling any type of chemicals including those used here so your eyes won’t get damaged from splashes caused during experiments involving these types of things. Always remember that you need good ventilation whenever doing anything related towards chemistry whether indoors outdoors etcetera otherwise people might start coughing due too fumes being released somewhere nearby which could end up causing problems later on down line even though we wouldn't know until after everything happened already! Make sure there isn't anyone around who doesn't understand how dangerous certain situations may become before starting experimentations/tests whatever else needs done first before proceeding further along with research regarding what kind(s) materials were going onto begin working upon next step(s) afterwards.""""If possible try"

It is called The Fairy Wren's Nest. This book is about how important it is to look after animals that are endangered or threatened by extinction. The illustrator of this book was Patricia Mullins. The story is set near the Great Ocean Road where there used to be many fairy wrens but now they only live in small patches of land around Lorne, Apollo Bay and other places along the coastline.

Many praised the cast performances but criticized the writing as being too slow paced at times with some saying that it did not live up to expectations or potential due to this reason. Some reviewers felt that the story could have gone further than what it did because there were so many unanswered questions left by the end which made them feel unsatisfied about watching all those episodes only to be disappointed when nothing came out of them later on down line either way though overall they still enjoyed seeing how things turned out between these characters involved within each other’s individual journeys throughout life together before parting ways forever afterwards leaving behind memories filled full heartache pain sorrow joy"
