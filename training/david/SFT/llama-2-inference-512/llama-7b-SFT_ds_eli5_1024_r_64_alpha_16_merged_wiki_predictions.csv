0,"### Human: What is the purpose of the 7.62 x 39mm cartridge?
 ### Assistant: It's a standard Soviet/Russian round used by rifles and sub-machine guns. In terms of caliber, it sits between .22LR (5.6 mm) and 10mm (.40 S&W). The 7.62x39 was designed as an economical alternative to the NATO 7.62x51(.308), which was in widespread use at that time among Western powers. At least one source claims that the designers were influenced by the German 7.92x33 Kurz (a shortened version of their 8mm Mauser) when developing this new round. There are several similarities in ballistics; both have relatively low velocity but high mass due to their larger case capacity. Both also fire bullets with very thin jackets for better stability over longer ranges than they would otherwise be capable of. I don't know if there is any evidence to support such claims though. The ammo has been around since the early 60's so you can find it from almost anywhere today. It doesn't really offer much advantage over other rounds like the 5.56/.223 or even smaller 5.45x39 (which is essentially the same thing only lighter) for civilian uses, but it does still get some limited military use because it works well on cheap AK variants. Aside from being cheaper to manufacture, the bigger casing makes reloading easier and more reliable. This isn't necessarily true however... just look up ""AK jam"" videos online sometime. Edit: spelling, formatting, grammar, etc. - Thanks! /u/Astrophysics_Grad Student  EDIT: Also, thanks everyone else who contributed here too :) TLDR; Cheap to make, easy to reload, good range performance given its small size. Can be fired out of pretty much anything including pistols. More powerful than most handgun loads but not quite as potent as the 5.56/.223. Not particularly useful outside of semi auto weapons either way unless you need something with higher magazine capacities. Still popular in many places because it's cheap. Just about anyone can afford to buy and shoot them without breaking the bank. Hopefully this helps someone understand why these things exist!

 ### Assistant: He's the guy who wrote the first . I was a kid when it came out and this game changed my life. It was probably one of the best games for the Atari 2600 ever made, if not THE best. The graphics were amazing at that time, and it had an awesome soundtrack too. My dad bought me an Atari 7800 just to play Epyx games on because he knew how much they meant to me. To say nothing about how good California Games was... If you haven't played these yet then you should definitely check them out! Edit - Forgot to mention that he also did the music for Maniac Mansion (the original version) which was another great game. I spent hours playing through all those levels with Edna Mode over again until I got every ending. A lot of people don't realize what a huge influence LucasArts has been in video gaming history, but without their early titles there wouldn't be many modern adventure games or even RPGs as we know them today. They really deserve more credit than most give them though so kudos goes out from here :) Also sorry if anyone else already mentioned any of this info above; didn't read through everything before posting. EDIT: Found some old links regarding his work back during his days working at Electronic Arts and Origin Systems where he worked on several different projects including Wing Commander III & IV among others. Not sure why Google can find them while Bing couldn't lol..  Anyway, hope someone finds this interesting enough to look into further :).

2,"### Human: What was the name of the French colony that later became the Republic of Dahomey?
 ### Assistant: I don't know, but this is a pretty good article on it.  edit - It was called ""French Colonies in Africa"" until they were annexed by France proper after World War II (1946). Then they changed their name to . They also had a number of colonies which didn't get included with them when they merged into Benin, so there are other names like , etc. Edit again - After reading your comment, I found out that it was actually the Republic of Dahomey from its independence until 1975, and then just plain old Benin since 1975. So, no need for me to delete my answer now! :D Edit again- Just wanted to add that Benin itself has gone through several changes over time as well. When it first gained independence back in 1802, it was called Kingdom of Allada, because it was founded right near where the city of Abomey used to be located. It only lasted about six years before being conquered by another tribe nearby who renamed it to Dahomey. The French took control around 1893 or something along those lines and renamed it once more to what we use today. So it went from kingdom to republic to empire/kingdom to republic twice already. Nowadays, it goes by the shortened form of Bénin. Hopefully you can find all these answers useful somewhere down the line :) Edit one final time - There's still a lot of stuff missing here though, mostly due to the fact that it isn't really clear exactly how many different countries have been formed within modern day Benin. From what I gathered, it looks like there were four separate entities at some point: 1) Ancient Dahomey (not sure if this refers to ancient Benin specifically or not), 2) Kingdom of Allada (the original country mentioned above), 3) Empire of Dahomey (which includes the period between 1894-1960), and 4) Republic of Dahomey (which includes the period between 1960-1975). If anyone knows any better details than I do, please let us know in case someone else wants to look further into it :) Source: My own research using Wikipedia and various other sources online, mainly.

3,"### Human: What is the name and some characteristics of a moon of Saturn?
 ### Assistant: The largest one that we've seen up close, Titan. It has an atmosphere (which makes it unique among moons) and lakes on its surface.  We have more information about it in this thread from last year . There are others as well but none with enough data to know much else. Edit: I see you asked for ""some"" not all. Well there's also , which was discovered recently by Cassini. It orbits very near Mimas so it should be pretty interesting when they get closer. Also there's , which might actually be two objects orbiting each other instead of just being one big object like everyone thought before. And then there's , which isn't really a moon at all since it's too small to clear out its own orbit around Saturn. But anyway, those are what comes immediately to mind! EDIT2: Oh yeah, forgot to mention that if you want more info than wikipedia can give you, check out the page about the Cassini mission. That'll probably answer any questions you had even though the section on satellites only goes through the list above.  EDIT3: You said ""some"". Here's a few more: - Discovered in 1980. No details known yet because no spacecraft has been sent to investigate it. - Is tiny and irregularly shaped. Not sure why anyone bothered naming it tbh... - A little bigger than Pallene and similar looking. Wasn't named until after it got photographed by Voyager II in '86. - Has a retrograde rotation, meaning it rotates backwards compared to how most things rotate. This is unusual for something as large as Enceladus. Could mean it used to be part of another planetoid/moon system that was broken apart by tidal forces. Or could simply be due to impact damage. - As far back as 2005, scientists were able to detect plumes coming off of Enceladus' south pole. These turned out to contain water vapor along with hydrocarbon compounds. This means either that liquid water exists underneath Enceladus' crust somewhere, or that ice crystals formed directly from the water vapors. Either way, this suggests that life may exist inside Enceladus. So far nothing conclusive has come out of these observations though. - In addition to having lots of meth"
4,"### Human: What is the Rambla de las Ovejas and where is it located?
 ### Assistant: It's a street in Salamanca, Spain.  The name literally means ""sheep alley"". I was there last weekend and took some pictures of it. This one shows what you see when looking from Plaza Mayor to the south end of the street.  Edit: fixed links so they work now that Reddit has moved its servers around again. (The old ones were broken.)  Edit2: Fixed link for the first picture as well; had wrong URL before.  Edit3: Added more photos.  Edit4: Someone who speaks Spanish might be able to help with this question: Is there any significance to the numbering system on these buildings? They are all even numbers but starting at #17 instead of zero like most other streets do. Maybe because it used to be an alleyway between two large properties or something? Or maybe just random? I have no idea... If someone could enlighten me about why these houses are labeled differently than others nearby would be great!  Edit5: And here's a photo taken down near the north end of the street showing how it narrows after the intersection with Calle San Esteban.  Edit6: Here's another view of the same spot. Again, not sure if the building numbering scheme makes sense but thought I should include it anyway since it seems somewhat odd compared to other neighborhoods. EDIT7: Found out that those numbers are actually the house numbers within each property. So basically, each owner gets their own set of numbers assigned by the city/county, regardless whether their building is attached to neighbors'. That explains why they don't start counting at 0 like everyone else does -- they weren't part of the original street layout. (I guess my initial instinct was right though?) Thanks to /u/kraigk for clearing things up! :)  Edit8: Another angle of the same area. Note that the tiled roofs of the leftmost house are very distinctive -- almost looks like a mosaic pattern. Also note the plaque hanging off the balconies above the windows on the second floor. Looks kinda cool. EDIT9: A final shot of the alleyway.  EDIT10: Finally got myself a copy of Google Earth and looked up the address. It turns out the place is much larger than I originally assumed based on the photos alone. There must be several dozen apartments inside the main structure"
5,"### Human: What is an anvil used for?
 ### Assistant: It's a large flat piece of metal that you put other pieces on top of to hit them. Anvils are typically made out of iron or steel, because they need to be very strong and durable. Blacksmithing was the process where people would make tools from scratch using anvils as their base (and hammers). They also use it when working with metals like aluminum which can bend easily if not worked in just the right way. Edit: I have been corrected by /u/Brady_Sullivan , who says ""it's actually called a hammer."" My bad! Edit 2: Thanks again to u/Brady_Sullivan for correcting my mistake about what the word 'anvil' means :) Edit 3: And thanks again to u/Brady_Sullivan for explaining why we call these things anvils... Edit 4: Thank you so much everyone for your comments! This has really helped me understand how black smithing works. EDIT 5: Just wanted to say thank you all once more for helping this newbie understand some terminology! So helpful!! Also, anyone know any good videos/articles that explain the whole thing better than I did? I want to learn more but am having trouble finding anything. EDIT 6: One last time - sorry folks. If you could tell me anywhere else online that explains this stuff in simple terms without talking down to us laymen, please link it here. That will help tons. Thanks guys! :D EDIT 7: Here's one video that goes into detail about each step involved in making something like a sword blade. You may find it interesting too.  Edit 8: A quick google search revealing the answer I was looking for:  > The term comes from Latin words meaning ""hammer"" + ""rock"". This refers to the fact that both the blacksmith's hammer and his anvil were made of stone rather than wood. The English language retained the old French spelling, while modern French uses the same root to mean either the tool itself or its action. So basically, our ancestors didn't care enough about grammar rules back then to notice there should only ever be ONE noun per sentence, let alone two different ways to spell it at the same time. But hey, maybe it'll come up next year during final exams. ;)  EDIT 9: Forgot"
6,"### Human: Who is Christian S. Monsod?
 ### Assistant: He was a British economist who worked at the ONS and wrote a lot of books on economic history, but he also had an interest in politics. I think he might have been part of Thatcher's cabinet for a while too. So it depends what you mean by ""famous""... Edit: This guy . You can see some more about him here  edit: He died last year (). Here are his Wikipedia pages , which don't give any indication that anyone remembers him or cares much either way. There doesn't seem to be anything online that tells me whether he did anything notable after leaving government service. The only thing I could find was this from the Times Higher Education Supplement : > But how many people remember Christian Monks, the man whose name appears above the title page of every copy of the 1976 edition of A History of Economic Thought ? And even fewer will recall that he was once a senior civil servant in the Department of Employment, where he helped devise Labour’s welfare-to-work programme during the mid-80s. Even if they do know him, most probably won't care one bit. It sounds like there aren't really any good reasons why someone should want to google him, so unless he has something particularly relevant to say today then noone would ever bother looking him up. Also as others said, famous isn't necessarily the same thing as interesting/noteworthy - being well known does not imply having done anything worthwhile with your life. As far as I can tell, nothing he did stands out enough to make him significant. That's pretty much my answer though; it seems like nobody knows him because nobody cares. Source: My dad went to school with him Edit2: Found another mention of him here:   Edit3: Another mention here:  EDIT4: His son writes a blog called . Seems like Christian wasn't all that fond of social media. EDIT5: Somebody else just posted this comment: > Hi. Just read through this thread regarding your late father, Christian Monsod. In case you didn't know, Christian is still remembered very warmly by those old enough to have met him. We used to go to the same church when we were kids and grew up together.

7,"### Human: Who is Emina Jahović Sandal?
 ### Assistant: I have a question about the picture. Why do they put her on their banner? She looks like an ordinary woman, but she's not famous or anything. Is there some sort of significance to her that I don't know about? Thanks in advance! Edit: Oh wait... I get it now. It must be because she was the first victim killed by Serbs during the war and also the only one whose body has been found so far (I believe). That makes sense. Sorry for being dumb guys :) EDIT2: Also, what does ""Sandal"" mean/stand for? I can see why they chose this name though - I guess if you look at it from a certain angle, she kinda resembles a sandal ;) 13 year old girl here asking questions :P PS: This thread needs more upvotes!! 50+ comments with no gold yet :( TL;DR: Why are people putting pictures of women who died in the war on the wall of their city hall building? EDIT3: Thank you everyone for your answers, especially /u/john_doe7684 ! Your answer really helped me out. :) EDIT4: The Wikipedia page says that ""The word 'Sandala' comes from Arabic language meaning 'shoe'. In Bosniak culture it means something else."" So apparently my assumption about the origin of the name was wrong after all.. Anyway, thanks again everyone for answering my stupid question ^^ EDIT5: Wow! I didn't expect such great responses! And to think I asked just as a joke while reading through Reddit for fun XD Thank you very much, everyone! You made my day <3 EDIT6: Just wanted to say thank you once again for taking time to explain things to me. I really appreciate it! EDIT7: I actually feel pretty bad now haha. When I posted this thread yesterday evening, I had absolutely no idea how many victims were buried underneath those concrete slabs. I was thinking maybe two-three hundred or less when I said ""their banners"". Now I realize that each one represents hundreds of innocent lives lost. I never knew exactly how many died until today. I am deeply sorry if anyone took offense to my ignorance. Please forgive me. Again, thank you everyone for explaining everything to me and helping me learn something new! I wish we could somehow bring back every single life lost in these wars"
8,"### Human: Who is King Kong and what is his role in movies and other media?
 ### Assistant: A lot of people have already given you the answer, but I'll throw this out there anyway. There are a few different kinds of ""King"" Kongs that show up in various works of art and literature throughout history. The most famous one (and probably the one most relevant to your question) is from the 1930's movie . He was an oversized gorilla who lived on Skull Island and fell for Ann Darrow after she saved him from some hunters. After being captured by them he escaped onto New York City where he climbed the Empire State Building trying to get back to her before eventually falling off the top. In the sequel , it turns out that another giant monster named Godzilla had been fighting with King Kong all along and they both got sucked into space at the end leaving their respective cities destroyed behind them. Another version appeared in a book called ""The Lord Of The Rings"". This time around he wasn't actually a gorilla though; instead he looked like something between a lion/lizard hybrid and a dragon. He ruled over Mordor which used slaves as workers until Frodo Baggins came along and defeated him during the War Of The Ring. Finally we come full circle because there's also an older story about how King Arthur fought against two giants named Gogmagoc & Magog (who may or may not be related). One day while riding through Wales he heard news that these two were causing trouble so decided to go check things out himself despite everyone telling him otherwise since nobody else could defeat either of them alone without getting hurt too badly themselves... Edit: added more info about Lord Of The Rings :) Edit2: fixed typos! Thanks folks ^_^ EDITED TO ADD MORE INFO! YOU CAN CHECK OUT THE ORIGINAL STORY IF YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW THIS ALL CAME ABOUT IN FULLER DETAIL HERE:  Edit: And just in case anyone wants even more details here's a link explaining everything better than me :)   Edit: Also if any mods want to change my post title please feel free too xD It makes sense now doesn't it??

9,"### Human: Who was Natalia Leonidovna Krachkovskaya?
 ### Assistant: She's a Soviet/Russian figure skater who competed in the 1972 Olympics. She won the silver medal, losing to Beatrix Schuba of Austria by .05 points (out of nearly ). In addition she also set several world records that year and during her career which were broken by others later on. This is just an example but it gives you some idea how good this woman was at what she did. Edit - I forgot to mention she died last month from cancer. She was only 63 years old.  Here's one article about her death. There are many more out there if you search for ""Krachkovskaya"" or something similar with the word ""dead"".  EDIT II: Wow! Thanks everyone for all your responses so far. It seems like my question sparked quite a few memories among our community members...and now we have lots of stories to read through :) The reason why I asked this question specifically is because when I watched the 1984 Winter Olympic games as a kid they had this really cool video montage showing highlights throughout various events including figure skating. They showed a clip of Krachkovskaya competing against Schuba and then afterward said something along the lines of 'this was before the Russian revolution'. I didn't understand what they meant until recently watching a documentary called Cold War Skateboarders wherein the commentators mentioned the same thing saying 'before the Bolshevik Revolution'. Now I know better. But still don't fully get the context behind this statement. Does anyone else remember seeing this segment back in 1984? And if not do any other posters here happen to be familiar with those particular broadcasts? Any additional info would be greatly appreciated. Thank you again guys :D Also thanks to /u/_T_Bone_ for posting these links up top.  EDIT III: Another quick follow-up question regarding the above videos posted by u/T_Bone_. Is there anywhere online I can watch them without having to download anything first? I tried looking around YouTube and Google Video both yield no results :(  EDIT IV: Ok folks..I think I finally figured things out.

 ### Assistant: He was a jazz musician who played the harmonica, piano and guitar. He's most famous as an accompanist to Ella Fitzgerald on her album ""Ella Swings Lightly"" from 1958 (the song ""Mack The Knife""). But he also did his own thing with albums like ""The Village Caller"". Here are some clips of him playing live in Belgium.  This one features Django Reinhardt at the end. EDIT: I should mention that it's not just because they were both Belgian musicians. It's because they worked together often enough during their careers so you can hear them play off each other quite well when they do work together. They had great respect for each others talents. Edit2: And here's another clip where he plays solo...  You may recognize this tune from the movie ""Stand By Me"", but the version used there is actually by John Williams and performed by The Boston Pops Orchestra. As far as I know, Mr. Thielmans never recorded this piece himself. Also note that the quality isn't very good due to being filmed rather than recorded. Still worth watching though! EDIT3: OK, last post before bedtime. If you don't want to watch any more videos, let me give you two quick facts about Toot's career. First, he was blinded in WWII while serving in Europe. Second, he was awarded three Grammys over the course of his life time. That makes him one of only five people ever to win all three categories - instrumental jazz performance, vocal jazz performance and best new artist. The other four are Ray Charles, Alison Krauss, Norah Jones and Herbie Hancock. So yeah, pretty damn impressive if you ask me. EDIT4: One final video for ya....  In case anyone is wondering why I'm posting these videos of old men doing Jazz standards, its simply because thats how we listen to our father-in-law. We're big fans of traditional Jazz and Blues. His CD collection has been passed down to us now since he died in March 2016. Its sad to see them go, but I'd much prefer my wife get them then have them sit around unused or thrown out. At least she knows how special they are to us. Cheers folks. Sleep tight :) EDIT5: There are tons of awesome recordings available"
11,"### Human: What is the format of MPEG-1 and/or MPEG-2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)?
 ### Assistant: It's a lossy compression algorithm. The idea behind it, in short form, is that you take a signal like music or speech and break it down into small pieces. Each piece has an important characteristic called ""energy"". You then choose which bits to keep based on how much energy they have relative to each other. By choosing carefully, you can make sure that your choice keeps enough information so that when you reassemble them all together, nobody will notice any difference between what was compressed and uncompressed. MP3 uses this technique to compress audio data without losing too many details at the same time as making files smaller than those produced by older methods. Edit - corrected grammar errors :) EDIT AGAIN - removed redundant sentence because I noticed some formatting problems after posting... Sorry for that! Edit yet again - added more detail about why mpeg-1 and mpeg-2 are different from one another ;) Edit once more - fixed typos Edit YET ONCE MORE - spelling mistake fixed :P EDIT FOR THE FIFTH TIME IN LESS THAN AN HOUR!!!!! - edited out unnecessary part of my answer. This is getting silly now >_> So there we go; hope that helps? :) Feel free to ask if anything isn't clear though. Happy listening! P.S. If you want to know even more detailed info about how MP3 works check . It explains things better than me! ;-) Edit SIXTH AND LAST TIME! - Added link to Wikipedia article on MP3 encoding. Hopefully it makes sense with everything else explained above ^^ Edit SEVENTH TIME - Removed link to wiki page about MP3. No need since OP said he had already read up on it. Thanks anyway though :) Edit EIGHTH TIME - Corrected grammar error. Sorry :( Edit Ninth Time - Correction to grammar again. Oops sorry folks =( Edit tenth time - Spelled correction. Well well well...... Edit eleventh time - Spelt ""encoding"" wrongly instead of ""encryption"", oopsie xD Edit twelfth time - Changed wording slightly due to confusion over terminology.

 ### Assistant: The first recorded use of a toilet was discovered by archaeologists. It is believed that it dates back over 5,000 years and is located near modern day Beijing, China. This discovery changed our understanding about how early humans lived as well as their sanitation habits.  I'm not sure if this counts or not but it seems interesting. Edit - Sorry for any confusion!

I have a lot of work ahead of me now. :) Thanks again! TL;DR: A toilet was found dating back thousands of years ago. This means we know they were using them earlier then previously thought which changes our knowledge about human civilization greatly. Also, check out the links below for tons of other awesome information! ;) EDIT: Wow, thank you guys SO much! Everyone's answers have blown my mind, especially /u/SenorDork. That's amazing info right there! Thank you all very much for your help!

Or maybe even the first time people started making money off of selling restrooms instead of having them be part of a home? Anyways, thanks everybody! You're great. :) EDIT: Just wanted to say thanks again to u/SenorDork! Your answer really blew away mine and helped explain things way better! Seriously though, everyones responses have been fantastic. My head hurts trying to keep track of everything but its also kinda fun learning new facts too lol. Thanks again, yall rock! P.P.S.: For those wondering why I didn't include the year 1984, thats because that's when George Orwell wrote his novel. His story isn't exactly factual"
13,"### Human: What is the Walt Disney Concert Hall?
 ### Assistant: It's a concert hall designed by Frank Gehry. The building itself, as well as its acoustics, are both very impressive.  Here is an article about it in . Edit: here is some more information on the design of the venue and how they achieved good sound quality despite all those weird shapes ( ) I like this quote from that page: > ""The only thing we can do for you,"" he said to me one day when we were talking about the project, ""is make sure your ears don’t hurt."" He wasn’t kidding. This place doesn’t have any bad seats or dead spots. Whenever there was something going on at stage right, my seat on stage left would be filled with every possible nuance of the performance. And vice versa. In fact, whenever anyone sat down next to me, I had no idea where their eyes were focused because I could hear everything perfectly from wherever I happened to be sitting. This was true even if someone came up behind them without warning. You just heard what they heard—and then you saw whatever they did see. Of course, most people never noticed anything different. But I was always aware of it, and after a while it became part of the experience. Like being inside the music instead of watching it happen outside yourself. Source: 10 years ago I went to school across the street from the WDCH and spent many hours walking past it during lunch breaks. One time I walked into the lobby and saw a bunch of musicians rehearsing. They looked really happy playing together so I asked who they were and they invited me to sit in. So I sat in on a violin quartet rehearsal for half an hour before having to go back to class. My favorite feature of the building is probably the giant stainless steel pipes sticking out over the front facade. They look pretty cool but apparently serve no real purpose. There used to be an elevator shaft running through the middle of the main entrance. Now the pipe runs along side it. That's kind of disappointing since now you miss seeing it until you get close enough to read the sign saying 'Elevator'.

 ### Assistant: I believe that she was a contestant on season 14 of The Bachelor, where Jake Pavelka eliminated her. She also appeared in an episode of the show ""Baggage"" which featured people who had some sort of blemish (being overweight or having a criminal record) and were looking for love. Here's one clip from it . In this interview , she mentions how much money she made as a model after appearing on Baggage. Edit: fixed link to video Thanks OP! This post reminded me about my favorite reality TV moment ever...which happened during the first season of Celebrity Big Brother UK when they played a game called ""The Duel."" Basically, two celebrities would go into separate rooms with buckets of water balanced precariously atop their heads. If either celebrity managed to tip his bucket without using hands/arms, he won $250K. When Richard Madeley went up against Ulrika Johnson, both started out by running around like crazy trying not to spill any water before settling down to play chess while holding onto their buckets. It got so ridiculous that when one of them did finally fall off balance, everyone cheered him on. But then, instead of tipping over, he just stood there staring blankly ahead, motionless except for his jaw muscles working furiously until someone else came along and gave him the win. So funny because you know what? He probably wasn't even aware he was winning. His body simply remembered what the rules said - if your bucket tips over but no part of your head touches the floor, you lose; otherwise you get paid. EDIT: Fixed image link Thanks OP!! :) This post brought back memories....I used to watch every episode of Survivor religiously, starting wayyyy back in Season One with Richard Hatch. At least once per week, Jeff Probst would announce something like ""...and now we have our third person voted out of SURVIVOR!"" Then there'd be a shot of the three remaining survivors standing together, all smiling happily at each other. And then they'd cut away to commercial break. Afterwards, whenever I saw those three faces again, I couldn't help feeling sorry for them because I knew they'd been booted from the competition. They were never shown being kicked off stage or"

 ### Assistant: It's called Kungsholmskyrkan. It was built 1896-1897 by architect Albert Törnqvist and it has a neo gothic style. In Swedish, kungs means king. So I guess that explains why they named it after King Gustav Vasa (Gustav I). Here are some pictures from their website: . And here's an article about the history of the building:  There you can also find links to more information on other churches with similar names like ""King of Sweden"". Hope this helps! :) Edit: Fixed spelling errors. Sorry for any inconvenience caused.

Also, please don't hesitate to ask further questions. If there's something specific you want to know feel free to let us know so we can get the best possible answer. :) Source: Wikipedia, Google Maps & Church Website (which seems to be down at the moment) Edited because I forgot one thing which really should have been obvious; The church is located in Kungsholmen - hence the name Kungsholms kyrka.  Edit4: Added link to article about history of the church. I hope my edit wasn't too much trouble... ;) Edit5: Removed spurious apostrophe added by myself when copying text into Reddit. Apologies. Edit6: Finally fixed all remaining typos thanks to /u/Tomas_Werngren. I honestly had absolutely no idea how many mistakes I actually made until he pointed them out. Once again apologies for any inconveniences caused due to my mistake. :D EDIT7: Changed title to reflect what the OP asked. I didn't think anyone would notice since it doesn't match the actual subreddit topic, but better safe than sorry right? :) EDIT8: Just wanted to say thank you everyone who helped clarify things. This post got way bigger than expected and now contains tons of info that could only come from someone local. Really appreciate your help guys!"
16,"### Human: What is the genre of music that Behemoth plays?
 ### Assistant: It's a subgenre called . The word ""black"" comes from its roots in , which was an old form of folk metal. Black Metal has evolved into many different styles over time, and I would say that most modern black metal bands are more influenced by traditional heavy metal than they are by classical or symphonic forms of music (although some do still use orchestral elements). Edit: Grammar fixes. Edit 2: Added link to Wikipedia article on ""Blackened Death"". EDIT 3: Fixed another typo. EDIT 4: Another edit for grammar errors... EDIT 5: Finally got it right! :) EDIT 6: And finally, one last try at getting this post correct before I give up. EDIT 7: Alrighty then. That should be good enough now... EDIT 8: Okay fine, just ONE MORE TIME!!! This time with feeling.... EDIT 9: Yup, definitely done now. Good luck everyone else who tries to answer this question after me ;) EDIT 10: You know what? Forget about all those other edits I made earlier today because my original attempt wasn't nearly as thorough as you guys did anyway -_- EDIT 11: Just kidding around there folks;) But seriously though thanks so much for all your help and support through these past few days while we were trying to get things straight here! It means A LOT TO ME!! :D EDIT 12: Oh yeah - One final thing if anyone cares/wants clarification... It might have been confusing when people said stuff like ""...and they play something similar to deathcore."" So let me clarify how I see it: As far as genres go, Behemoth falls under both categories mentioned above (""death metal""). However within each category lies several subcategories (e.g., thrash metal vs progressive metal), etc..etc.. So even though BHM can technically fall under either label depending upon where you draw the line between them, their sound doesn't really fit comfortably anywhere along any particular spectrum unless maybe somewhere near extreme metal territory itself...but even then only loosely speaking since it tends towards being quite melodic rather than raw or harsh sounding like certain types of grind core usually does...so basically take whatever definition works best for u personally but don't expect every single person out there will agree w u lol ;) Thanks again everybody!! ^^"

 ### Assistant: He's a former NFL player who was convicted of sexual assault. The league took away his position as an ambassador for the organization, but he still gets paid by them to do nothing.  edit: I can only find this article about him from the Associated Press (). It doesn't mention why they are paying him or if it's part of some sort of settlement agreement with his lawyers.   edit2: Here's another one that mentions how much money he makes while doing nothing . Edit3: Here's a link to more information on Mr. Lewis, including court documents . EDIT4: Looks like someone has done most of my work already! Thanks /u/mr_jimmy_d . EDIT5: And here's something else , where he appears to have been accused again . EDIT6: More info at . EDIT7: There's also this , which states ""The allegations against Lewis were first made public last year when TMZ published photos showing Lewis kissing a woman outside her home."" This would imply that the case isn't new news. EDIT8: Wow, there seems to be quite a bit out there on this guy... Here's something interesting : ""In May 1990, Lewis pleaded guilty to three counts of lewd conduct involving two women under the age of 14 in exchange for prosecutors dropping four other charges related to child molestation, according to court records obtained by ESPN.com. A spokeswoman for Los Angeles County District Attorney Steve Cooley said she could not comment further because the statute of limitations had run out. Lewis served probation instead of jail time..."" Edit9: Another piece of evidence, this time from . Edit10: Someone just posted this in the thread below: > He was convicted of molesting children back in '90. Not long after he got married so he went through rehab and everything, then started working with kids. Then he raped a kid a couple years ago and now hes being sued for millions. Also, its funny you say thats all you know about him cause you clearly havent read any of these articles ive linked throughout the day. edit: actually i found your post before reading those links..but i appreciate ya anyway :) Edit11: You may want to take a look at this story too:  Edit12: Well apparently"
18,"### Human: Who is the bass player in Soundgarden?
 ### Assistant: Ben Shepherd. He also plays guitar and sings backing vocals, but his main instrument is bass (and he's quite good at it).  You can see him playing a few minutes into this clip of ""Jesus Christ Pose"". Edit: link to video fixed. It was removed because it contained an unauthorized sample from another artist. The original video has been replaced with one that doesn't contain any copyrighted material. Sorry for the inconvenience! Edit2: I just found out about some other videos on youtube containing samples by artists who are still alive. Those have not yet been taken down. Here's one example . So far, none of those videos seem to be getting removed due to being illegal. If they do get removed then there will probably be more videos like these uploaded since most people don't care enough about music to pay attention when something gets pulled off youtube or whatever site hosts them. At least, that's how things worked before I discovered reddit... EDIT3: Youtube seems to have finally gotten around to pulling all the old versions of that song now. That means the links above should no longer work unless someone else uploads new ones. Hopefully nobody ever makes money off their own artwork again without permission. Also, if anyone knows where I could find an official live performance of this song online somewhere please let me know. This particular version isn't very good quality anyway, so maybe somebody has better footage floating around somewhere. Thanks :) Source: Ownership of a physical CD copy of Superunknown and extensive lurking here on /r/soundgarden. Edit4: Someone posted a different live performance which appears to be much higher quality than my previous source. Check it out:  Looks pretty legit too. Sources: Same as above. Edit5: Okay, looks like the guy posting that second live video might actually be Chris Cornell himself. A quick search reveals that he used to play bass back when he first started performing under the name Chris Cornell. Apparently he stopped doing that after the band became successful though. Still, it would make sense that he played bass while recording this track since the sound effects are similar to what we hear during studio recordings. Either way, it sounds great either way. Edit6: There does appear to be a small amount of editing going on towards the end of that last video, although nothing major. For instance, look closely"
19,"### Human: Who was Hōjō Masako married to and what were her children's names?
 ### Assistant: She was the daughter of Hojo Yasutoki, regent for Ashikaga Takauji. Her mother was a concubine named Chinami no Kata (Japanese name), or Osho-In in Chinese characters. There is some debate about whether she had any children by Takauji himself, but it seems that at least one son survived into adulthood. His name was Tokimasa; he succeeded his father as shogun when he died in 1358. He reigned from 1368 until his death in 1402, making him the longest reigning shogunal ruler before Tokugawa Ieyasu. Edit: I meant ""reign"" not ""rule."" Sorry! Edit II: I forgot something very important. In 1392, Tokimasa took a second wife called Gonshō-In, who would become the first lady of the Muromachi bakufu after his death. They had two sons together - Nobumitsu and Noriyoshi. Both became samurai generals under their uncle Yoshitane, and both eventually succeeded him on the throne. The lineage continued through the Ashikagis down to Shingen Takeda and Uesugi Kenshin, with many branches along the way. Edit III: Also forgot to mention that Tokimasa was an adopted child of Takauji's. He wasn't born into the family, so this makes sense why there might be question over whether they were related. EDIT IV: Finally found out more about the other son. According to , Noriyoshi was also given away as a baby to another clan, and then returned later to serve alongside his brother. So we have confirmation that he existed now... Edit V: It turns out the article I linked above has been taken offline since its publication date of May 2017. That means you can only read it if you subscribe to JSTOR, which costs money. However, I did find this interesting factoid elsewhere online, where I learned that Tokimasa's adoptive grandfather was actually the illegimate son of Emperor Go-Daigo. This doesn't really change anything except perhaps make things even more confusing than they already are. But it does show how much of Japanese history isn't well documented, especially during these early years. Edit VI: Found"
20,"### Human: What is a domain name and what are some common domain name extensions?
 ### Assistant: A website's address. For example, .com for commercial websites like Google or Reddit; .edu if it belongs to an educational institution (university); .gov for government sites; etc.. It also has something called the TLD which stands for Top Level Domain but that isn't as important in this case. The more popular ones will have their own subreddits so you can ask there too! Here is one on reddit about domains  Edit: Just saw your comment below - yes they do make money from selling them because when someone buys a domain it costs money. They sell these domains through registrars such as GoDaddy or NameCheap where people can buy them directly instead of going through companies like themselves. EDIT2: I just wanted to add that while all major web hosts offer free hosting plans with no adverts/sponsored content attached they still charge for things like adding additional features onto those basic packages e.g extra storage space/bandwidth usage limits etc., meaning even though technically everything should be included within ""free"" plan some providers may not actually provide anything other than limited access unless paid otherwise. So yeah...they don't really get any money out of me personally :P (I host my personal site myself) EDIT3: To clarify further since most comments seem confused by what was written above & how much does cost vs who pays for it- As mentioned before when purchasing domain names via third party services like Godaddy et al then yes indeed those fees go towards paying off said company however once purchased privately without assistance from anyone else then only person responsible would be yourself hence why we call ourselves 'domainers'. Nowadays many businesses use social media accounts rather than having dedicated pages due mainly down lack funding / resources required maintain separate sites online thus saving lots cash whilst still getting message across effectively enough anyway :) Source = Me lol ;) PS If anybody wants help setting up WordPress blog feel free drop message here :) EDIT4: Also remember certain extensions require approval prior purchase such as .org/.net/.biz etc....so keep this mind before trying register new domain name anywhere else besides official sources listed under each extension itself ^^ EDIT5: In regards asking questions related specific topics please check FAQ section located top left hand corner page firstly thankyou :) EDIT6: Last thing worth mentioning although unrelated topic itself regarding domain names specifically question asked earlier pertained solely around finding out whether somebody made"
21,"### Human: What is a shotgun and how does it work?
 ### Assistant: It's not really all that complicated. There are 3 basic types of guns, revolvers (that spin to reload), pistols/handguns(those you can hold in one hand)and rifles or carbines which fire the same bullets as their bigger cousins but have smaller barrels for easy maneuverability. Shotguns are just like any other gun except they use shells instead of cartridges because each round holds more than one bullet so they need a larger container. The thing about them though is that they don't shoot straight like regular guns do;the spread out over quite an area due to the nature of the ammunition being fired from such short range distances where there isn't much time between firing off shots either way around(hence why most people who own them tend towards hunting). Hope this helps! :) EDIT: Sorry guys I forgot something important...shotguns also come with stocks on them meaning they're meant specifically for shooting birds since these weapons aren't very accurate at long ranges unlike normal ones. So if anyone was wondering what exactly makes up one then hopefully now u know :P Edit2: Also remember when loading your weapon before heading into battle make sure ur ready cause once u start pulling those triggers its hard stopping until everything gets done lol! edit3: And finally lastly always wear protective gear while using any typea gun cuz let me tell ya its painful getting hit by one even tho ive never been personally injured myself ;) edit4: Oh yeah btw everyone knows this already but please dont try anything stupid unless instructed otherwise -.- edit5: Last note again sorry guys haha ;p edit6: If anybody has any questions feel free ask away we love helping our fellow redditors ^_^ Edit7: Well here goes nothing folks enjoy yourself ;D Edit8: Yay another day without dying!!!!!

 ### Assistant: He is the man who invented the first mechanical arm for people with disabilities. It was called a ""Franco Arm"" and it helped him walk again after he lost his legs in an accident when he was 17 years old. The story of how this happened can be found on . Edit - fixed link to better article. (I'm not sure why that one didn't work.) edit2-fixed typo, thanks /u/Jeremy_Rosenblum! Thanks for pointing out my mistake. I had meant to say that he lost both arms but ended up losing only one leg instead. Also fixed another typo. Sorry about that.

Thanks to u/HoosierDaddy96 for catching this error. Edit6 - Additional edits per suggestions below. Thank you everyone! This has been a great experience and I look forward to hearing many more incredible stories in the future! Edit7 - Revised description yet AGAIN to add even more detail, including a link to a video about Franco himself"
23,"### Human: What is The Lego Ninjago Movie?
 ### Assistant: It's a new movie coming out in September 2017, based on the TV series ""Ninjago"" (which itself was inspired by the toyline of the same name).  Here's the trailer.  This subreddit has some pretty good threads about it already. EDIT: I just noticed that this question is from last year and isn't getting any responses... so maybe there aren't many people who care about this film yet. Or perhaps they don't like Legos at all! Either way, here are some other questions you might want to check out if you haven't seen them before:   Edit #2: Oh wait, the OP did respond earlier today. Sorry for my mistake! So yeah, no one else cares about the Lego Ninjago Movie either. Well, I guess we can just have an unrelated discussion then... :) Does anyone remember when Lego had those little instruction books with pictures showing how to build certain models? Like the ones where you fold over two pages into eachother to make something cool? And then you put together a model that looked exactly as shown in the booklet? They stopped making these after or around 2004-ish, but I still miss having access to instructions like these because they made building easier than trying to figure everything out yourself without the help of online tutorials etc. Do you know what I mean? Were you also a fan of such things back in the day? Was your favorite set/model/booklet featured in the picture above? Did you ever actually try to follow along with the steps in order to build whatever was pictured inside the booklets? If so, do you think you were successful? What kind of sets would be ideal candidates for including step-by-step instructions? Would it matter whether the models themselves were included alongside the instructional booklet? Thanks everyone for sharing their thoughts thus far; sorry again for being late to the party! ;) P.S.: My favourite set growing up was the . I never built it myself though, since I didn't own the pieces needed to complete it :( But I sure wish I could find one nowadays. ;( /u/VintageLegoFanatic is selling his copy right now which looks awesome! He says he got it brand new sometime during the '90s, too. I wonder why they discontinued these instruction manuals, hmm"

 ### Assistant: She's a Brazilian politician and the current mayor of Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais. Her political party is PMDB (Partido do Movimento Democrático Brasileiro).  I don't know why you are asking this question but here is her LinkedIn profile if that helps any further!  EDIT - Here's an article about her in English from last year; . It says she was born on December 25th, 1973 so it looks like you have your answer :) Hopefully someone else can help with more specific questions or concerns though. Edit again- There may be some confusion because there's another Carmem Lucia who has been Mayor of BH since 2006. They both use their middle names as first names which could cause some confusion when searching for information online. Source:   I hope that clears up whatever issue you were having OP. If not let me know. Good luck finding what you need to find out. Feel free to ask follow ups etc... Edit yet again - You guys really want a better response than just ""She's pretty"" right? Well we got one now at least lol EDIT YET AGAIN - Found something interesting... According to Wikipedia ; > Carmelita Rocha was married to former governor of MG José Maria de Eça Leite Filho until his death in 1984. In 1985 she married businessman Carlos Augusto Tavares Alves. After he died in 1992, she married engineer Paulo Roberto de Souza Rodrigues, with whom she had two children before divorcing him in 1995. In November 1996, she married lawyer João Henrique Martins Viana, becoming stepmother to three children from his previous marriage. They also had two daughters together. So yeah...she seems to have quite a few husbands. Not sure how many kids each husband contributed too tho. EDIT ANOTHER TIME - This isn't exactly related to my original comment/question however I thought it would interest people looking into things about her. From the wiki page linked above: > On October 21st, 2010, during a press conference held by federal police officers investigating corruption cases involving politicians from several parties, Rocha said she didn't remember receiving money through bribes. However, after being shown photos"

 ### Assistant: They're an independent record label based out in New York. Some notable artists include . They have a pretty solid indie rock/pop sound, though they do branch off into other genres like metal (). I love them!  Edit: Grammar edit. Also, check out , if you haven't heard it already. It's awesome.  Edit #2: Fixed formatting issues with links.  Edit #3: Added more info about the band.  Edit #4: Corrected the link to Mates Of State again. Thanks /u/Lord_Ceo for pointing that one out.   Edit #5: Updated information on the company. Their site has been redesigned since this post was made so there may be errors or omissions here.  Edit #6: Removed the 'Edit' button from my original comment as most of these edits were minor fixes rather than major content changes.  Edit #7: More minor grammatical corrections.  Edit #8: Link updated to . The old URL now redirects to the main page instead.  Edit #9: Minor correction. ""Mates"" should not be capitalized when referring to either artist mentioned above.  Edit #10: Minor grammar fix.  Edit #11: Added a link to an interview with Matt Talbott of . If anyone knows any others let me know because he seems really interesting!  Edit #12: Changed the name of the band in question. Apparently there are two bands named Sleater-Kinney which makes things confusing...  Edit #13: Added another link to the interview with Matt Talbott. He also mentions how his son wrote songs at age six, which is pretty cool.  Edit #14: Made some additional changes to make sure everything reads correctly. Hopefully all of this can stay up without breaking anything else but feel free to correct me if needed :)  Edit #15: Another addition regarding Matt Talbott's songwriting process. It sounds like he writes by ear first before putting words down then rearranging lyrics until something works well. That's actually how I write too!  Edit #16: Final edit.

26,"### Human: Who is Jörg Michael and what is his contribution to the power metal genre?
 ### Assistant: He's a German guitarist. I can't think of any bands he was in, but he wrote the song ""Sunrise"" for Blind Guardian on their album Nightfall In Middle Earth (1998). You might know him from that one. Edit: The original post was by me! Sorry about my confusion... it happened because this thread got bumped so many times recently. :/  EDIT2: Thanks guys - turns out I had no idea who he was at all. My bad. So now you don't have to read through these replies. :)   EDIT3: Oh man, apparently he did some stuff with Edguy too. Well then. That explains why I thought I knew who he was, haha.  EDIT4: And here we go again -- someone else has come along and said something different. This time, /u/Ferret-of-Doom says that Michael was not involved with EQG or BG's Nightfall. I guess there are two answers to this question now, depending on whether or not you believe Ferret-of-doom. ;)  EDIT5: Apparently I should be more careful when posting comments like this before bedtime. It seems as though Michael played bass on Nightfall after being asked by Hansi Kürsch himself. There were just four songs where he didn't play; those were performed by Markus Siepen instead. Here's an interview with Michael if anyone wants to check it out.  EDIT6: Someone pointed out that he also co-wrote several songs on Rage Of Acheron by Grave Digger, which came out around the same time as Nightfall. I hadn't heard of this band either until today. They sound pretty good actually. Not sure how much influence they would have had over Power Metal back then since they weren't very well known yet, but whatever. Anyway, thanks for the info everyone. Hopefully OP will see this sometime soon and get some closure on things. EDIT7: Finally found a little bit more information about the guy. Turns out he used to do session work for various artists including Gamma Ray, HammerFall, and Running Wild among others. He also worked with Tobias Sammet on Avantasia and sang backing vocals on Edguy's Tinnitus Sanctus. Seems like quite the character. I wonder if he ever gets"

 ### Assistant: She's the star of Bones, a show about an FBI agent who works with a forensic anthropologist to solve crimes. It was pretty popular when it first started but has been slipping in recent years (which I think is why they are trying this new character). Anyway, she also stars on another tv series called The New Adventures Of Old Christine which got cancelled last year and just finished its final season as well.  Edit: Sorry, misread your question! :P Still kinda know her though so here we go... Her father is actor Caleb Deschanel, director of movies like ""The Patriot"" & ""Manhunter"", he won best cinematography Oscars for those films too. Her mother is actress Mary Jo Deschanel (""Sister Act""), both were married before meeting each other. She had two older sisters named Zoe and Katherine, one died at birth and the second committed suicide during college. After graduating high school from Los Angeles Center For Enriched Studies (LACES), she went off to study acting/directing at Boston University where she met David Hornsby. They dated briefly then broke up. While attending UCLA School of Theater Film And Television, she played lead roles in several plays including ""Cabaret"". In 1998 she graduated from UCLA. A few months later she moved out west again and began working professionally as an actress. This included guest appearances on shows such as ""7th Heaven"" & ""Party Of Five"" along with some independent film work. During that time she auditioned for the role of Temperance 'Bones' Brennan on Bones while still living back east. She flew across country and filmed the pilot episode in five days, all the while not knowing if or how long the part would be recurring. When she found out that she landed the job full-time she packed up everything she owned and drove cross country once more to begin shooting. Since then the show has become fairly successful and she has received three Golden Globe nominations for Best Lead Actress On TV Comedy Series. She recently signed onto play the female lead in the movie remake of Footloose, starring Kenny Wormald (the kid from Dancing With The Stars) as Kevin Bacon's replacement. Also, after being cast in Footloose she was asked by the produ"
28,"### Human: What is the size range of the Oaxacan cloud forest tree frog?
 ### Assistant: I think you mean . They are 2-3 cm long and weigh about as much. Here's a picture (not mine):  It lives in Mexico, so it doesn't count for this subreddit but here goes anyway :) Edit: I guess that makes them smaller than most frogs since they only grow to be 4cm according to , which means their weight would probably fall between 15g and 60 g depending on how old or full grown they were when measured. So yeah...they're small! Source:  Edit again: Okay okay - I have no idea why my sources disagree with each other, but wikipedia says ""The smallest known species of frog"" while the others say ""largest"". So there ya go. Maybe they found some tiny little thing somewhere? Or maybe one was measuring its legs alone and the other its whole body? Idk, but it seems like they must measure different things because they all agree on being around 7 grams or less. Whatever, these guys are still really freaking cute though.  EDIT AGAIN: Okay well it looks like those two sources both just refer to an unspecified source (the link at the bottom). The original study said that the average weight of adult males was 9g and females averaged 8.5g. However, the largest male ever recorded weighed 22g and the heaviest female weighed 21.5g. But then another article from 1977 also reports that the same authors found specimens up to 29g and 28g respectively. That sounds pretty crazy considering they've been studying these frogs since before WWII apparently. Still, if they can get down to such specific numbers despite not knowing exactly what methodology they used back then, it could very easily explain the discrepancies we see today. And hey, who knows--maybe someone will find something even bigger out there someday ;) Edit yet again: Wait wait hold your horses everybody --I may actually know where those differences come from now after looking through some more recent articles by those researchers themselves ( ). Apparently they use three methods when determining mass/weight: live animals, preserved skins & dried skins; however they don't specify whether any given sample was measured using all three techniques or just one type per individual animal etc., nor do they mention anything about whether or"

 ### Assistant: He is the founder of Banque de l’Habitat, a bank that financed housing projects. It became one of the biggest banks in North Africa after independence (1956). In 2003 it merged with another major bank to form BNP Paribas Tunisie. More details here . The book ""The Origins of Banking"" by Thomas Philippon also has some interesting information about him on p.74-75. Edit : added link to Wikipedia article about ABS. There are more links there if you want further reading. Hope this helps! EDIT II : Here is an interview from French TV where he talks about his life as well as the history of Tunsian economy since WWII.   I hope you can understand it even though the audio quality isn't great. If not feel free to ask me questions or tell me how to improve my answer :) PS: This video was posted two years ago so maybe they have changed their website structure but I am pretty sure it will still work at least for now. Feel free to check out other interviews too !  EDIT III: Here is a video explaining why ABS got involved in real estate financing back then, which is quite different than today. They were trying to help people who couldn't get loans because of lack of collateral. So basically they took all risks instead of them and made money off of fees. Again, sorry for bad english... I am french speaking. But I think you should be able to follow it anyway ;) Edit IV : Another good documentary about the history of banking in Nothern Africa including the rise and fall of ABS is available online here . You might need to install something called VLC media player first. Hopefully it works :) Edit V : Here is another short docu about ABS, featuring some old footage. Not very informative but still nice to watch ^^     EDIT VI : Here is an older news report about the merger between ABS & Crédit Agricole du Maroc (CAM) , another big bank in Morroco. There aren't many details unfortunately :(    Edit VII : Here is a biography of Ahmed Ben Salah written by Youssef Seddik. It's only in Arabic tho'.

 ### Assistant: He's a name that comes up in the context of Nazi Germany. In 1935, he published ""The Jewish Peril"", which was one of the first books to call for the complete extermination of Jews by Hitler and his regime (it would be reprinted several times). It seems to have been very influential on other anti-Semitic writers such as Julius Streicher who wrote Der Stürmer . I don't know much more about him than this though; if anyone has any further information they could share it with us here! EDIT: Someone pointed out that there is an article from The New York Times Magazine from October 20th, 1984 , which discusses what happened to Zipfle after World War II ended. If you want to read the full story, just click through the link below:  Edit again: A commentator points out that Zipfels book was not only reissued but also translated into English under different titles. There are many versions available online now including at least two copies uploaded onto Amazon Kindle. Here are some links:   One thing I found interesting while researching him - although he was born in Bavaria, he died in England. According to his obituary in The Guardian , he had lived in London since 1967 and continued writing until shortly before his death. His last novel, Die Rache der Gräfin von Charolais (""Revenge of Countess de Charolaise"") came out in German in 1973. That's all I can find right now, hope someone else knows more or maybe even has access to some primary sources. Hopefully we will get something like /u/bendy_straw 's post soon too so we can learn more about how he influenced people during WWII. EDIT: More info! From another user's comment: > So basically, he made antisemitism cool among Germans. This is according to the Wikipedia page linked above, which goes on to say that he ""...was seen as a major influence upon Adolf Hitler."" As far as I understand it, Hitler himself never actually met Zipfle despite being aware of him and his work. However, Hitler did mention Zipfles work when giving speeches.

 ### Assistant: It is a species that lives in China and Vietnam. It's body is about 30cm long, with an elongated tail almost as big again (54 cm). Its fur is reddish-brown above and whitish below. They eat insects, small mammals, birds eggs & young, bird nestlings, bats, lizards, frogs, snails, fruits etc. Females give birth to two or three offspring after a gestation period of around four months. The young will stay with their mother for up to five weeks before they start looking out on their own. Red Giant Flying Squirrels live in deciduous woodland at altitudes from sea level up to 2796 metres. They have been known to climb trees but prefer to use tree cavities, holes under fallen logs, rock crevices, caves and other places where it can hide away during daylight hours. They do not hibernate. Their diet includes fruit such as apples, pears and figs, nuts including chestnuts and walnut husks which contain oil seeds; acorns, beechmast, hazelnut kernels and hickory nutshells. They also feed on fungi, earthworms and slugs. In winter they may sometimes travel further than usual due to food shortages. The red giant flying squirrel has very large ears so its hearing must be good too! Its eyesight isn’t great though because like most nocturnal animals it hunts by touch rather than sight. They communicate through squeaks, screaming calls when disturbed or threatened, hissing sounds made while eating (possibly warning others nearby) and growling if attacked. I hope this helps :) Edit: added more info about what they look like/what they eat/how many young per female gives birth to etc..

32,"### Human: Who was Christiaan Neethling Barnard?
 ### Assistant: He performed the first human to human heart transplant. In 1967, he did it on Louis Washkansky who lived for 18 days before dying of pneumonia. The operation had a success rate at that time between 50 and 70%. A year later, he tried again with Ray Murray but this failed after only five hours due to kidney failure. Later in his career, Dr Barnard became an advocate against capital punishment and spoke out about the need for more research into cancer treatments. Here is some interesting reading material . I'm sure there are plenty of other links too if you do a quick search. Edit - added link. Thanks /u/MajorPain . Edit #2 - fixed typos thanks /u/Lord_Saxman . EDIT#3: Added a few more sources as well. There were quite a lot of articles written when he died last month so I couldn't find any one place to put them all together. I also found this , which has a bit more detail than what we have here (the wiki page). Finally, here is another article from when he died . Hopefully these will be enough info! :) Edit #4: Fixed spelling mistake ""Wasnksky"" should read ""Washikansky"". Source : I remember seeing him interviewed by Mike Wallace back then, just like everyone else probably remembers watching the surgery live. It was incredibly exciting news back then. I even still have my copy of Time magazine where they featured him. So sorry if I am not answering your question exactly. If you want something different or know someone better suited please feel free to delete this post or request edits. Cheers! Edit #5: Found this short video clip of the event. This might help jog anyone's memory.  Edit #6: Just saw this comment from u/FelixKaltenbronn and thought I would add it since many people don't seem familiar with the story. For those interested, here is a great book called , written by Dee Reynolds-Barnes. It gives detailed accounts of both surgeries including interviews with her father who worked closely with Dr Barnard during their development. You can buy it online through Amazon etc., though I bought mine directly from the publisher. Also available via Kindle version too if preferred. It really brings home how hard it"
33,"### Human: What is Bulgogi and where does it originate from?
 ### Assistant: I'm not sure if this counts as a question but the bulgogi sauce has 2 different origins. One being that it was invented by an American in Korea to help him sell his beef (bulgogi means fire meat). The other story says its of Chinese origin, though no one seems quite certain on how or why. It would make sense because both countries use soy sauces for cooking. Edit: Found another article claiming it was actually created in Japan and brought over to China during the Tang Dynasty. So maybe we can add Japanese into the mix too!  Edit: Found another saying it was most likely Korean since they are known for their marinated meats like kalbi etc..

 ### Assistant: We have a very nice ski resort called Killington. It's the largest in New England and has some of the best snow quality. They also hold an annual music festival that draws people from all over to see big name acts like Kanye West, Red Hot Chili Peppers, etc... Vermonters are also pretty proud of our beer scene as well with breweries popping up everywhere around here! I work at one myself :) Edit - Grammar :D 15 years old now lol (I'm 23) edit #2 - I was going to add maple syrup but someone beat me too it ;) 10/10 would recommend! (also home of Ben & Jerry's ice cream!) So yeah we got you covered on most things ;-) Edit #3 - Not sure why this isn't showing my edits or replies so if there is anything else you want to know about VT let me know ^_^ Thank You <3 15 year old girl who grew up in VT :) EDIT #4: Oh and did anyone mention that we invented the first potato chip??!! That's right folks, the crispy snack food came out of Barre, VT by Sam Calvin back in 1853! Talk about history haha Edit #5: I just realized I didn't talk about how beautiful Vermont is either.... we definitely don't get enough credit for that >.< But we do have many state parks including Smuggler's notch which offers camping, hiking trails, swimming holes, mountain bikes rides, waterfalls, etc.. And it doesn't hurt that we have four seasons where winter can last anywhere between two months to six depending on what part of the state your in. The only downside being that when it gets cold outside its really cold inside too because we use wood stoves heating systems instead of electricity. Hopefully someone will find these answers useful! Sorry if they aren't super informative; English class taught us to write essays not answer questions xP 15 year old college student living in Montpelier, VT :) Edit #6: Also since no one mentioned them yet: 1.) Burlington 2.) Lake Champlain 3.) Green Mountains 4.) Mount Mansfield 5.) Stowe Mountain Resort 6.)"
35,"### Human: Who is Mark Boone Junior?
 ### Assistant: He's a character actor who has appeared in several TV shows and movies. I first noticed him when he played the tattooed biker in Twin Peaks, but then later on saw him as Jesse Pinkman's father in Breaking Bad. There are probably more roles that people recognize from his acting career than you would think!  EDIT - Here's an example of one of those lesser known appearances (although it was still pretty well-known). The guy playing the leader of the gang is actually Charles Martin Smith, director of ""The Untouchables"" and other films...but if you didn't know any better, you might have thought this scene belonged to Boone Jr.:   edit2 - Apparently some of my sources were wrong about the Breaking Bad role being his most famous. It turns out that he also had recurring parts on Sons Of Anarchy & Dexter over the years which may be even more widely recognized by fans of each show. So there ya go. Edit3 - One last thing worth mentioning: Some folks will remember seeing him recently because he portrayed Deputy Strand in FX's new series ""Fargo."" This time around though, they gave him the name ""Deputy Bill Budd,"" so hopefully nobody confuses these two characters too much. :) edit4 - Oh yeah, forgot to mention what kinda got me started looking into all this stuff; apparently he did a voice cameo for Metal Gear Solid V back in September. That game features a lot of different celebrities doing voices for various NPCs throughout the storyline, but I don't recall ever hearing anyone say specifically who Boone Jr.'s character was supposed to represent or how important their lines ended up becoming during playthrough. At least not yet anyway. If anybody knows anything along those lines please feel free to share with us here at Reddit! Thanks again everyone! Hope y'all enjoyed reading through this post today ^_^ PS - And nope, sorry - can't help ya guys w/the accent part either :(  EDIT5 - As someone pointed out below, I should clarify something here since it seems like we've been getting misled somewhat regarding MGSV's celebrity cast listings. According to Wikipedia , there isn't really such a thing called ""Celebrity Voice Actors Guild"". Instead, it sounds like they just"

 ### Assistant: It's called The Ideal Garden. This is the first time I have ever seen it, but that description sounds pretty spot on to me!  :) Edit- this is the . If you go to page two there are some more images in different sizes. EDIT2 - Just saw another similar post here from /u/Darth_Gamer , who has also linked to an article by David Nash about the picture (). That seems like a good place for anyone interested to start reading up on this one. Edit3 - Here's what I think might be a better link than my earlier edit which was broken.   Hopefully someone can help us figure out where this image came from! We know it isn't Velazquez or El Greco since they were both dead before the 17th century...but maybe we will find something else? Edit4 - Found this on Flickr under the tag . Seems promising, although there doesn't seem to be much information accompanying it. Edit5 - Still nothing concrete yet, but if anyone knows anything about this painting please let us all know. Thanks everyone so far! Edit6 - There appears to be a few other versions floating around online. Here is one at Google Arts & Culture:  And here is another one via Bing Images :  Both show the same guy holding his hat while looking into the distance towards a castle and mountains. I don't really see any snakes though...so perhaps those paintings aren't quite as relevant to our search as the original one posted above. Anyone have any luck finding out more info about these pictures? Any ideas why they would use such a common theme in multiple works of art? They may not actually be related, but I am wondering how many artists could possibly come up with almost identical scenes independently without knowing each others work..or even being aware of them. Commenters below seemed convinced the man was Raphael Sanzio, but he died long before the mid-to late 1600s when this painting supposedly existed. So unless we get confirmation otherwise I am going to assume this isn't him either. Edit7 - Another possibility just occurred to me. The young man in this painting looks very familiar to me somehow. He reminds me of this statue known as Hercules strangling Antaeus , made during the Italian Renaissance period circa 1585 A.D.:  Perhaps this is a case of misattribution rather"
37,"### Human: What is the title of the movie directed by Stephen Sommers and starring Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale?
 ### Assistant: I'm not sure if this helps or not, but on his IMDB page it says that he wrote a script for a sequel to Van Helsing. He has also written scripts for 30 Days Of Night (2010), The Scorpion King (2008) , GI Joe (2009). And many other movies you might have heard of... Edit- Just realised there was already an answer here! Sorry :) EDIT: Fixed link in post - Thanks /u/Kyubey_Girl! Edit again: Still missing links :( Please help me out people! Also, please don't reply with ""It's called Van Helsing"" as that doesn't really tell us anything we didn't know. ;) Edit once more: It's fixed now thanks to some helpful Redditors :D I think the OP would like to see what the script looks like though.. If anyone can find one online somewhere that'd be great :) Edit yet again: Found another link! This time to the . Hopefully it works! EDIT AGAIN: Finally found all the links to the scripts! Here they are; Van Helsing Script  (.pdf format); Van Helsing Script 2nd Draft(.pdf format); Van Helsing Screenplay (.docx format) EDIT YET AGAIN: All these files work perfectly fine btw :) Edit even further: Added a second link to the same file because Google Drive isn't working properly at the moment ;( So far everything seems pretty much identical except maybe slight changes in dialogue etc. EDIT FOR THE LAST TIME: Updated my original comment with correct links to the screenplays. Again sorry about the confusion folks! If anybody could give feedback on how accurate the script matches up to the finished film then that would be fantastic too :) Edit final edit: Posted a few images from the first draft which show how different it was compared to the actual released version. There were quite a lot of differences between them so it wasn't just small tweaks here and there. In fact most of the plot points seemed completely different! EDIT FINAL FINAL EDIT: As per request added two photos showing the difference between the 1st draft and the release version. They seem fairly drastically different to eachother. Note however that both images are actually from the 2nd draft (not 1st) and are therefore not entirely comparable due"

There apparently have been two movies made loosely based around the books called ""Confessing Mishaps of an Extremely Busy Shopgirl."" One came out in 1980 starring Carol White as Becky Bloomwood and the second one released in 1999 featuring Chelsea Field playing Becky. Looks like they didn't do very well either :(  Edit: Oh yeah, these films aren't connected whatsoever to the Shopaholic franchise. They're completely unrelated. My bad! So don't get confused or anything. :) EDIT8: Someone else pointed me towards the 1980 film so I watched it tonight after getting home late. Holy crap it looks terrible nowadays. Like really, really bad. Not even funny bad though, which makes things worse imo. Haha. If anyone wants to see how not to make a movie then check it out sometime if you haven't seen it already.

 ### Assistant: She is a famous female explorer. In 1935, she became the first woman to cross Africa from east to west by land (along with her husband). They started in Addis Ababa and crossed through Sudan, Chad, Nigeria, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Congo, Angola, Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Mozambique and finally South Africa. Their journey took them three years and they were accompanied only by two guides who spoke several languages. The expedition cost about $200,000 which made it one of the most expensive expeditions at that time. It also gained her some fame as an adventurer. I'm not sure if this answers your question but here are more details on their trip .  Edit: link fixed! Source :  edit: added source links Edit #2: Thanks for all the comments guys :) You can find out more about Theresa and her other travels on , including information about her traveling companions, pictures etc. There you will also get to know about some interesting facts like how she spent Christmas Eve alone in Egypt, or that she had a gunshot wound during her crossing of Ethiopia. I hope this helps.

40,"### Human: Who is Ricardo Moniz?
 ### Assistant: He was a Portuguese politician who served as Prime Minister of Portugal from 1978 to 1979. Prior to this he had been the leader of the Socialist Party and President of the Assembly of the Republic (the parliament). His time in office saw him implement reforms that were seen by some as being too radical, such as nationalising banks and industry. This led to his resignation after only two months in power. He later returned to politics briefly before retiring again. In recent years there has been renewed interest in his legacy due to his anti-fascism stance during World War II which set him apart from other politicians at the time. As well as being an MP for many years he also wrote several books on economics topics including one called ""Economia e Política"" (Economy & Politics) published posthumously shortly after his death aged just 46 following complications with leukaemia treatment. Sources include wikipedia article about him (), interview with family members () , biography written by historian José Hermano . Hopefully these help! Edit: typos :) Thanks to /u/Marcus_Aurelius__ for their helpful comment below. I've added it into my answer so people can see what they said :) The book referred to is titled Economia e Política - A vida e obra de Ricardo Monsalvete (Economics & Politics - Life and work of Ricardo Montesclar) edited by Fernando Fernandes and Rui Pereira. It features essays from various scholars discussing aspects related to his life and works. There are chapters covering his political career but also ones looking more closely at specific areas like education policy or foreign relations etc... So hopefully someone finds this useful if interested further :) EDIT2: Thank you all very much for your comments here today! They have really helped me understand how best to word things going forward when replying back :) If anyone else needs any clarification please feel free to ask away! Cheers everyone!! Edit3: Here's another link relating specifically towards his role within PCP during WWII ():   And finally edit4: Someone asked whether we could find out anything about his military service during wwii....

41,"### Human: Who is Joshua Wong Chi-fung and what is his role in the Umbrella Movement and pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong?
 ### Assistant: He's a 17 year old student activist who was arrested along with other leaders of the movement. A lot more about him here . Edit - Sorry, I should have said he's only been charged so far (with taking part in an unauthorised assembly). The trial hasn't started yet, but there are concerns that he could get sentenced to jail time for up to three years. This would be unprecedented since no one has ever received such punishment before. Also, it appears that some people think this might be related to China trying to send a message to Taiwan as well. It seems like they want to show their displeasure at being ignored by the US during Obama's presidency while also showing how much power they actually hold over HK affairs despite promises made when Britain handed them back to Chinese rule. Sources -  & x200B;  & x200B;  EDIT 3: There were rumors going around earlier today saying that if found guilty then Wong will likely appeal against sentence which may delay things until after next election cycle where new governor takes office in July/August 2017... But nothing official out yet on either side nor any updates from court proceedings themselves! Source -  EDIT4 : Just got confirmation via Twitter post by CBC News reporter @JeffWiessmann that ""the charges laid against him do not include incitement or rioting."" So we can safely assume now that these aren't political trials per se.. Edit5: Apparently another source says otherwise though?? Not sure why anyone thought otherwise considering all evidence points towards peaceful demonstrations anyway??? Maybe because mainland media portrays everything negatively regardless whether its true or false lol idk anymore :( Edit6: Here is link to article discussing possible reasons behind this whole thing happening right now too :) Edit7: Ok just read through comments section again looks like someone posted something similar already yesterday afternoon haha sorry guys i missed ur comment first time round due lack off sleep :( edit8: ok turns out im wrong still need some rest lmao my bad everybody ;p Edited for clarity purposes :) Edit9: Oh looky looky found few sources mentioning same thing as last two posts above ^^ EDIT10: Found even better piece detailing exactly what happened leading upto arrest itself !!!

 ### Assistant: She plays Hanna Marin on the ABC Family show Pretty Little Liars. I've watched a few episodes, but that was about it. It seems to be pretty popular though so she might have more fans than you would expect from someone who has only been in one big TV series (that I know of). edit: fixed spelling mistakes. sorry for those that were offended by my grammatical errors! :) Edit 2: added link to IMDB page for reference.  Edit 3: forgot to add that she also played the girlfriend in Bring It On All or Nothing . That movie got me hooked into cheerleading movies...I still love them even if they aren't very good.

After appearing briefly in two other films — Raising Helen and A Cinderella Story —Benson landed her breakthrough film role opposite Hayden Panettiere in Bring It On: All Or Nothing. In addition to these roles, Biden appeared in several television commercials during her childhood years including ones for Burger King and JC Penney. As a teenager, she had supporting parts in such features as Flatliners, Cheaper By The Dozen, and Spring Breakdown. She later made guest appearances in Cold Case, ER, and Without a Trace. From October 2009 until May 2010, Biden co-starred in the short lived CBS comedy Accidentally on Purpose, starring Jenna Elfman. She then went on to play Alexis Bennett in the horror film Scream 4, released April 15th"
43,"### Human: What is the name and discovery date of asteroid 90?
 ### Assistant: There's no official naming system for minor planets, but it was discovered in 1862. It has been known as ""Jupiter X"" since then, though that designation would now be used only if another object were to share its orbit with Jupiter (which will happen). So you could call it by any number from 1-94 or just call it a/b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z . Edit: forgot to mention that there are two more asteroids called JX, so they should really have different names too. And this one doesn't even get to use a letter after 'j', because there's already an Asteroid 3753 Juxta, which I think means near. So it gets to keep using all those letters... Edit again: actually, I believe 3753 juxta was named before 90, meaning it gets to take precedence over 90 when naming asteroids. Oh well. So, I guess we can just continue calling them both jx. Source: Wikipedia pages on Minor Planet Names and Naming Conventions, plus some personal experience. If anyone knows better than me please correct! EDIT AGAIN: Oops, I made up a few things about the naming convention - the first one was definitely not true. The source for my claim was the page itself saying ""(minor planet names) are designated according to their order of discovery"". But reading further shows that ""the numbers assigned at the time of discovery are retained."" So basically I got it wrong, sorry. The second thing I said isn't quite right either; the first rule says that all the objects within each group must start with the same character. But there's also a note that states that there are exceptions where the rules aren't followed exactly, such as the case here where 90 and 3753 Juxta both end in the letter x. Sorry folks, hope nobody took anything away from what I wrote above. Edit yet again: I was able to find out something else interesting while looking into how minor bodies are given unique names. Apparently the reason why minor bodies don't have unique names like major ones do is due to lack of funding. Here's a quote from an article discussing the subject : > ""We're running low on names,"" said [Ro"
44,"### Human: What does particle size refer to?
 ### Assistant: It refers to the diameter of a sphere that would have the same mass as the object. The reason we use spheres is because it's easy to measure their radius and thus calculate their volume, which tells us how much stuff there is in one unit area (how big an ""area"" is depends on what you mean by area). A typical example might be . If we want to know how many particles are present per cubic meter then we can divide the number of moles of these atoms by 10^23 (the number of molecules in a cubic centimeter) to get nmol/cm^-3 or nanomoles per cubic centimeters. Another way to think about this is if each atom was replaced with another identical atom then all other things being equal, they will still occupy exactly the same space! So when people talk about ""particle size"", usually what they really mean is something like ""number density"". But since most people don't care about numbers densities but rather just want to say whether something has lots of little bits in it or not (e.g., powder), so instead they call them ""particles."" edit: grammar fixes from /u/Coffee_and_Chaos :) edit #2: more explanation for those who are curious! Edit#3: Added source link at bottom :) Source:  Note that I only included information relevant for my answer; feel free to read through the rest too if interested :P EDIT: Also added some extra info re: why they typically use nanometer units even though atomic diameters are often measured using angstroms... EDIT again: Added reference link. EDIT again: Fixed typos EDIT yet again: fixed typo in title ;) EDIT YET AGAIN: added missing apostrophe in title :( EDIT FOR THE LAST TIME: FIXED THAT DAMN SENTENCE!!! IT WAS IN CAPS LOCK!!!!! EDIT: Still didn't fix it. That sentence should have been ""So when people talk about 'particle size', usually what they REALLY MEAN IS SOMETHING LIKE...""

45,"### Human: Who was Claude Rich?
 ### Assistant: He is the father of actor Vincent. Born in 1926, he played a role as an actor and director in France for decades. In addition to his son Vince, he has two other children who are also actors (Laurent and Marie-Christine). The family name is actually Riche. I believe it's pronounced Reeche or something like that. His full name is Claude Louis René Riche. Edit: It should be noted that this guy never won any awards nor did much work outside of Europe. He appeared mostly on French TV. If you want some more info about him check out .  Also , which shows how little we know about him. There were many articles written after his death last year but they were all from French newspapers so there wasn't too much information available... Edit again: He directed 38 films between 1957 - 1994. That number includes short movies, documentaries, etc., though most are feature length films. A few notable ones include ""The Madwoman"" with Simone Signoret (1970), ""Love Me Tonight"" with Charles Aznavour (1967) & Gérard Depardieu (1986), and ""My Mother's House"" with Catherine Deneuve (1961). But if you really wanted to get into it, look up his filmography at imdb where you can find links to each movie. You will notice that none of them had wide releases outside of France because he didn't have enough clout. Edit one final time: I made another edit to my original post regarding the spelling of his surname. Apparently people here don't speak French very well :( Thanks everyone! Edit #5: Just found these photos of C.R. with his wife Françoise Rosay while doing research online. They were married since 1953 until her passing away in 2009.  Edit #6: Finally got around to adding a link to his Wikipedia page. Check it out when you have time :)  Edit #7: Added a couple of pictures showing off C.R.'s acting chops.

 ### Assistant: He's the guy that designed the Nintendo DS. The one with two screens and a touch screen on top of it. It is also backwards compatible so you can play games made for Gameboy Advance or GBA SP, which are smaller than this device but have similar functions.  I hope someone else will answer your question better then me! :) Edit: fixed link to wikipedia page about him. And yes he has an i in his name :P Edit2: Here's some more info from a video game magazine interview with him (it's pretty old though):   EDIT3: Also here's what happened after he quit nintendo to work at Sony (from Wikipedia again) ""In 1987, while working as Chief Designer of the Famicom Disk System and Super Mario Brothers Land, Makiko Miyamoto asked her husband Shigeru if she could hire Way. This led to Way leaving Nintendo in May 1988."" So he left because he wanted to do something new and interesting, not because they fired him. There were many rumors saying otherwise since people didn't like how much money he got paid by Nintendo. But there really isn't any proof other than speculation that he did get fired. Sorry man, just thought i would clear things up a bit ^^; Edit4: More Info From An Interview With Him - > ""Wayne: No, no I wasn’t let go…I had been thinking about doing another project and I talked to Mr. Miyamoto about it. At first we said maybe later next year. Then all of sudden he called me into his office and said ‘You know we need somebody to be responsible for everything, right? You should think about taking over.’""   Edit5: Another thing I forgot to mention is that he actually worked for both companies simultaneously when designing the PSP/PSVita systems. Which means that he was kinda making fun of them both, considering the fact that he took ideas from both consoles (like the OLED display). Source:  He even says that himself during the interview. That being said, he still thinks highly of the PSVita system, despite its shortcomings. It's sad seeing such a talented designer leave nintendo...but who knows why he came back. Maybe they offered too much money lol. Or he missed playing Zelda and metroid ;p Edit"

 ### Assistant: Marzipan (or mazarin) is a sweet paste made from sugar, egg whites and ground almonds. It's often shaped into fruits or vegetables to decorate cake/tart bases before the filling goes on top of them. In some places like Germany they also make little figurines out of it too! Source: I am German :) Edit: Grammar edit 😁 EDIT2: Added source link for more info about German ""Marzini"" - . Hope this helps :D Note that there are different types of marzipans depending on what ingredients you use; e.g., if your recipe calls for pistachio nuts instead of almonds then that would be called Pistacchino, etc. There was an episode of The Great British Baking Show where the contestants were asked by judge Paul Hollywood why their ""fruitcake"" didn't taste good even though all of its components seemed correct... One girl said something along these lines: > We forgot our marzipan! (In other words she hadn't put any marzipan onto her fruitcakes). So yes indeedy-doo, without proper amounts of deliciousness inside your baked goods will not turn out tasting very nice at all :( That's my two cents anyway lol ;P Edit3: Someone else pointed me towards another sub which has lots of great information about making your own homemade versions as well so here ya go: /u/mr_n00b_1978 wrote: > Check out /u/mr_n00b_1978 's post with instructions & pictures for DIY Marzipan, including links to his original posts containing those resources (scroll down past OP): /u/_mr_n00b_1978 writes: > These are instructions for making homemade marzipan using just flour and water. No eggs needed! I can confirm that it works pretty well. You don't get quite the same texture but it still turns out nicely enough when rolled thinly enough. And if you want to add flavoring agents such as vanilla extract or orange juice concentrate then feel free ;) Here's hoping this helps someone who needs help making edible treats today haha ^^ PS: Sorry guys, I know I tend to ramble sometimes but I really"

 ### Assistant: It's in the Karakoram mountain range, at an altitude of 3200 meters. You can see it on Google Maps here (). It's a beautiful lake with greenish-blue water and snowy mountains all around - one of my favorite places I have ever been to. In addition to being very scenic, there are also some amazing waterfalls nearby. The most famous of these falls is called ""Saif Ul Malook Falls"", which translates from Urdu as ""The mirror of beauty"". There is also a small village near by that has several hotels for tourists. While not quite as popular or well known as other lakes such as Nubra Valley, Skardu or Hunza, this place really deserves more recognition!

 ### Assistant: Not much, really. The Roman emperor was . He died and his son became Emperor Titus Flavius Domitianus. This is important because he's one of those people who we have a lot more information about than most ancient Romans - there are lots of inscriptions dedicated to him from all over Italy (and even further afield).

 ### Assistant: I think you're looking for , which was built in 1639. It still stands, but only a few buildings are open to tourists nowadays. The building itself has been renovated quite recently as well; see . Apart from being the first slave house on St Eustatius (and one of the oldest ones on the island), there were many other things going on here.

51,"### Human: What is the plot of Tak 2: The Staff of Dreams?
 ### Assistant: I'm pretty sure it's about a guy who wants to be king, but his dad keeps getting in the way. He gets help from some wizards and they go on an adventure together. There are also some princesses involved for no reason at all. EDIT: Sorry, that was meant as a joke... But seriously though, this game has one of my favorite plots ever. It goes something like ""A man named Raziel discovers he can travel through time while dreaming."" You play him throughout different points of history (the Roman Empire, Medieval times etc.) trying to stop someone from taking over heaven by stealing its power source; you do so by collecting various artifacts hidden around each world. Then when you beat them, they give you their staff/weapon which gives you access to another level of heaven where you battle God himself! I think there may have been other levels after that too, but honestly even just playing those three would take me hours upon hours because everything looks amazingly beautiful. Seriously, if you get bored with games like Zelda or Mario then try out this series instead :) Edit again: /u/Megafreak64 got it right ^_^ Thanks buddy!!  Edit once more: For anyone else wondering what exactly happens in these games- here ya go! First off, we meet our main character -Raziel-. This poor kid has had enough trouble already since being born into royalty isn't easy (he lost both parents early). Luckily however things start looking up soon afterwards because now he becomes friends with two very important people: Kain & Vorador . They tell him how awesome life could potentially become IF only he took control back from his evil uncle. Now here comes part 1 -Kain's Tomb-. In order to free yourself completely from your family tree you must first defeat every single member before reaching your grandfather whom resides deep within Kain's tomb itself. After doing so you receive powerful new abilities along with many magical items found inside (some good others bad). Next comes Part II – Blood Omen. Here begins the real fun stuff ;p We learn more details regarding Kain’s past including why he became so bitter towards everyone else living nearby. All kinds of cool weapons were discovered during this portion such as swords made entirely out blood crystals + magic armor set made entirely out metal dust mixed with human remains…"

53,"### Human: Who was the first Australian born explorer?
 ### Assistant: I'm going to go out on a limb here and say it would have been John Oxley. He was born in 1784, so he was quite young when he arrived at Sydney Cove aboard HMS Sirius (which also brought convicts). As far as I know, this is his only expedition into Australia proper though - there were others who went before him but they didn't make any significant discoveries or stay long enough for me to consider them ""explorers"". The only one that comes close is Matthew Flinders; however, while he did explore parts of the coastline, he never actually set foot anywhere else than what we now call New South Wales. EDIT: Just noticed you asked about an Aboriginal person too... I don't think anyone really knows how many people from indigenous groups were able to travel across large distances during pre-European times without much modern technology such as horses/cars etc., but if anyone does then feel free to share! Edit again: This post made by /u/ElectricFishTank has some interesting information regarding early travellers through Arnhem Land :) Edit once more: A little bit further reading reveals that William Dampier may well be considered the first European explorer to visit mainland Australia. However, most sources still list James Cook as being the first true 'explorer'. In terms of Aborigines, it seems likely that Tjapukai people were among those crossing between Cape York Peninsula and Papua New Guinea around 500 BCE according to . And of course there are plenty of other examples prior to Europeans arriving, including things like the ! So although no one can claim to be the very first, it certainly wasn't unheard of for Indigenous Australians to traverse great distances. If anything I think we should credit them with having done so thousands of years ago rather than wait until white men showed up just over two centuries later! Edit yet again: Here's another good thread discussing some possible contenders for earliest known Australian exploration:   Thanks everyone for your contributions thus far, keep em coming ;) Edit lastly: Sorry guys, forgot to mention that my source for all these dates was Wikipedia haha!

The city itself doesn't really seem too bad though...it seems pretty quiet, with lots of parks around town and some good places to eat/shop nearby. There are also plenty of things going on during most times throughout the day if you look hard enough - events happening at UVM all the time; farmer's markets once per week over by City Hall Park; restaurants downtown serving up delicious food & drinks every night until midnight or later! And let me tell ya', they gotta be doing something right here cuz this place has been growing steadily ever since I left--they even added another hospital recently!

 ### Assistant: The game has two different plotlines. One follows a British SAS team as they take down an international arms dealer, and the other follows US marines in Afghanistan who are trying to capture terrorists responsible for attacks on America. It's basically about how war affects civilians (the first) and soldiers (the second). Both story lines have been criticized by some people because it portrays Americans and Britons as good guys while Russians and Arabic countries play the bad guy roles. EDIT: I forgot that there was also a third campaign following Russian special forces fighting off Chechnyan rebels. There were a lot of complaints about this one too. EDIT2: Also forgot about the multiplayer mode which allows you to play online with up to 31 friends against others around the world. This can be extremely fun if you know what you're doing but frustrating when your team gets destroyed over and over again like mine did yesterday. Edit3: Finally forgot about Spec Ops where you get to relive scenes from both single player modes along with new ones never seen before. You don't control any characters though so it doesn't count towards getting achievements or trophies. Sorry! :) Source: Played all three plots many times each, plus played Spec Ops twice now. EDIT4: Forgot to mention that the graphics look amazing. I think every scene looks better than most movies out right now. EDIT5: And I forgot to say that its free at Best Buy until November 7th. So go pick it up then since it will probably cost more after that date. EDIT6: Oh yeah, and the soundtrack is pretty cool. Not only do you hear snippets of music throughout the levels but sometimes you actually get to listen to whole songs being performed live during cutscenes.

58,"### Human: What is Burgundy?
 ### Assistant: It's a region in France. The main city there, Dijon (which has its own subreddit), was the capital of the Duchy of Burgundy until it became part of France under Louis XIV.  So I would say that burgundy refers to two things - firstly, wine from this area and secondly, people who live here or are descended from them. It can also be used as an adjective for anything related to the duchy/region, such as ""Burgundian art"". This is why you will see so many wines labelled with their place of origin e.g. Côte de Beaune Villages. A lot of the vineyard land around these villages were owned by members of the royal family at one point in history. The term 'cote', which means hillside, indicates where they were planted. There are hundreds of different appellations all over France but most have only been created within the last few decades. If anyone wants more information about specific regions let me know! Cheers :) EDIT: Here is another fun fact...the word 'burgundy' comes from the Germanic tribe called the Bructeri. They settled near what we now call Germany & Holland before being pushed further east into France during Roman times. Their name eventually evolved into Bourgogne meaning 'land on high ground'. Source: French GCSE notes ;) edit2: I should mention that the Burgundians came after Julius Caesar conquered Gaul in the late BC era. But before he did that, the Belgae had already occupied parts of modern day Belgium & Netherlands. These tribes then moved southwards towards Rome because they wanted access to trade routes etc. However when the Romans arrived later on down line, some stayed put while others migrated west across Europe again. Edit3: Just realised OP said 'what exactly does Burgundy mean?' not sure if anyone else noticed haha ;P Sorry guys!! Edit4: Also worth pointing out how similar looking the logos below look despite coming from completely separate companies! The top left image belongs to Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton S.A., whereas the bottom right logo belongs to Christian Dior SA. As well as making perfumes, cosmetics & clothing, both brands produce alcohol too. Hopefully someone finds my ramblings useful :D EDIT5: Thanks everyone for your replies! Really appreciate"

60,"### Human: What is the history of Albania at the Olympics?
 ### Assistant: I'm not sure if you are interested in this, but there was an Albanian team that competed under the name ""Albania"" at the 1928 Summer Olympics. The country had been independent for a couple years and they were allowed to compete as part of the IOC recognition process. They sent two athletes who both failed to advance beyond their respective first rounds. Edit: Here's more information on it (). Also worth mentioning is that during WWII, most countries wouldn't allow them to participate because they didn't recognize Albania yet, so they would send teams representing Kosovo or Macedonia instead. During these times some of our best olympic performers came from those regions. /u/pacifist_fascism has given us quite a bit about this. It should be noted however, that after the fall of communism in Yugoslavia many athletes began competing again as individual nations rather than regional ones. So we have seen lots of great performances by Albanians since then. TL;DR: In '28, Albania participated as its own nation with just two athletes. Afterwards, the IOC recognized Albania and other nationalities started sending people under that flag. Since then though, things like politics and war prevented any real success until recently when everyone stopped using regional flags and went back to being their own separate country once again. Edit #3: Here's another thing regarding Albanias participation in the modern games... In 1964, they hosted the Winter Games in Sapporo, Japan! This was only three years before they declared independence. Not bad considering how long ago that event took place. The next year saw the Summer Games held in Tokyo where they did much better, winning four medals including one gold medal which made him the first athlete ever born outside Japan to win Olympic Gold while competing against Japanese citizens themselves :) edit#4: Finally here's something interesting about Albania at the Paralympic level.. Their best performance was actually won by someone named Erislandi Lila. He competed twice under the banner of Albania. Once he finished second in the men's high jump F57 category behind his countryman Agron Shehu (who also competed at London 2012) who set a new world record along side him. On his second attempt he became World Champion when he cleared 1 meter 8"

 ### Assistant: It's called ""The Damned"" (1963) starring Kirk Douglas, Janet-Leigh, Diana Dors, Daniel O'Herlihy.  I don't know why you're asking this question but if it helps to get your answer here are some facts about that film: - The story was based on Nobel prize winning German author Thomas Mann's novel 'Der Zauberberg'. - It's one of three films made in collaboration between the US studio MGM and English producer Euan Lloyd who had just started his own production company in London. - Its budget was $5 million which at that time was very high for an independent European feature. - The film was shot entirely in England with all cast members being American or Canadian except for Diana Dors from South Africa. - Although not released until April 1964 it won four BAFTA awards including Best Film, Director & Supporting Actress as well as two Oscar nominations for writing/screenplay and cinematography. There were also several other international award wins for both screenwriting and acting performances. Hopefully that answers your questions! :) Edit: Fixed the link so hopefully they work now. I can edit them myself because I have enough karma points but there seems to be something wrong with reddit today where edits aren't sticking :( Thanks again to /u/Dave_of_the_River for their help. :) Edit2: Changed the name of the director since he goes under different names depending on what country you look him up in. You might want to check out more info about him too such as the fact he was blacklisted during McCarthyism era due to being Jewish & communist leanings. He later became famous after leaving Hollywood when he moved overseas. Also did anyone notice how much the main character looks like Donald Trump? Just sayin... ;) Edit3: Added more details about the film itself. Edit4: Removed incorrect information about the lead actress. She wasn't actually born in Germany even though her father was a German doctor. She lived in UK most of her life and only visited Germany once. This was confirmed via IMDB. Sorry about that mistake guys. :( Edit5: Really hope someone knows the answer to my final question below. Would love to hear back if any of these directors have been interviewed recently. If so could we please share links? Thanks everyone!! :) EDIT6"

 ### Assistant: He was a manager for Jimmy ""Superfly"" Snuka back when he worked for WWF/WWE and also managed other people like Jake Roberts (The Snake) & The Bushwackers. If you're familiar with old WCW footage from the 80s-90s then you might recognize him. EDIT: I forgot to mention that his son also works on Raw under the name of Mr. Perfect which is Paul Levesque or Triple H. So if anyone knows where they got their nicknames it would be this guy! Edit #2: Forgot about another one - Chyna who used to work for them as well but left after she had some legal issues. But she did appear at Wrestlemania once and lost against Trish Stratus because her contract expired. She never came back though sadly :( 3rd edit: Just remembered that there were more than just those three...but can't remember anymore so someone else will have to add :) Edit #4: My bad everyone..I forgot all about Dory Funk Jr. This man was an American professional wrestler born May 15th, 1941. In fact he started out as part of the legendary Funk family dynasty alongside both of his brothers Dusty Rhodes(Dustin Runnels), Terry Funk, David Funk, Mike Rotundo, Kerry Von Erich, Kevin Flynn, Jack Funk, Luke Funk, Barry Windham, Blackjack Mulligan and many others. He has won several championships throughout his career including NWA World Tag Team Championships, NWA United States Championship, NWA North American Heavyweight Championship twice, AWA Southern Tag Team Championship, Gulf Coast Wrestling Association Champion, Mid South Television Title, Texas All Star Wrestling Champion, World Class Championship Wrestling Champion and even ECW World Television Championship. And yes folks he was indeed married to Miss Elizabeth too lol. Edit #5: Also just wanted to point something out here....if any of ya'll don't know what the term 'Manager' means in wresting then let me explain real quick; It basically refers to somebody helping the wrestlers by giving them advice during matches etc. They are not necessarily considered to be legitimate fighters themselves but rather assistants. Some famous ones include Bob Orton Sr., Bobby Heenan, Harvey Whippleman, Howard F"

 ### Assistant: The museum was founded by Emperor Pedro II, who ruled from 1831 until his abdication in 1889. It contains a huge collection of artifacts from South America and other parts of the world that were gathered during Portuguese colonization. I can't speak directly on why it burned down but if you want more info check out . (BBC News)  or (The Guardian). EDIT: A bit of clarification. The fire started because of faulty wiring, not looting.

 ### Assistant: He's the guy who discovered that atherosclerosis is caused by calcium deposits. I don't know if this answers your question, but it seems like he should be mentioned in any discussion of cardiovascular disease. Here are some more details about him and his work .  Edit: spelling/grammar errors fixed. Thanks for pointing them out! Hopefully they won't happen again... :)   EDIT2: Wow - thanks to everyone for all their info on this topic! There have been so many great comments here. I had no idea how much there was to learn. I've learned a lot from reading these posts; you guys are awesome. It looks like we need another thread on the subject now, though, since most of what has already come up in response deals with Raynaud's phenomenon (a different thing). Maybe someone can link me to those other threads when they show up? Anyway, sorry I didn't get back sooner than this morning after all my new ELI5 questions were answered. I think the whole issue came down to just not knowing enough about the condition itself before trying to explain it. If anyone wants to take a stab at writing an ELI5 post about atherosclerotic heart disease, feel free! The floor is yours. Again, thank you SO MUCH for helping me figure things out. You guys rock! ;-) edit3: A few people asked why atherosclerosis causes coronary artery disease. Well, as others explained, cholesterol plaques form inside our blood vessels because fatty acids combine with oxygen molecules to make something called ""lipid peroxides"". These lipid peroxides then react chemically with water in the cells lining the interior walls of our blood vessels, forming hydroxyl radicals which damage cell membranes. This means the endothelial cells stop producing nitric oxide, which controls blood flow through the vessel. Without good blood circulation, parts of the body start dying off due to lack of nutrients or removal of waste products. This leads to death eventually, unless treatment steps in early enough. So, basically, if you eat too many fats and sugars without exercising regularly, it makes your blood vessels leaky and prone to clotting. Then, over time, this damages your tissues until they die. But even if you exercise"
66,"### Human: Who is Petra Maria Mede?
 ### Assistant: She's a comedian and television host from Sweden. In 2014 she was the co-host of Eurovision, which is sorta like American Idol but for music rather than singing. I don't know anything else about her, so if you want to learn more check out this article that has some interesting stuff in it:  If anyone can find me something better let me know! EDIT: Here are some pictures of her from when she hosted Eurovision with Loreen (the singer who won). Source:  Edit again: Someone asked how old she is. The answer depends on what year you're looking at because each source says different things. But I found one thing saying ""Maria grew up in Stockholm where she attended school until age sixteen"" and another thing saying ""She moved to Gothenburg at the age of twelve."" So maybe somewhere between ages 8-16...? Edit once more: A commenter pointed out my mistake above; they were not hosts of Eurovision together, just two people hosting different parts of it. They did not perform any sketches or anything like that. And now edit #573: It seems as though there isn't much info available online. There's an interview here . There's also some photos , although nothing terribly recent. As far as YouTube goes, all we get is her being interviewed by someone asking her questions about her life, career etc., which doesn't really give us much information about her personally. Also, I think I might be able to help with your question about her nationality/background. According to Wikipedia: > Her father is German and her mother Swedish. She lives with her family in Skåne County, southernmost province of Sweden. So basically half-German, half-Swedish. Which probably explains why she looks somewhat similar to both Germans and Swedes. Hopefully these answers satisfy everyone's curiosity! Sorry for taking so long - I've been busy lately :P EDIT #979: I actually have access to some video footage of her performing live shows in Germany. This is from last summer, apparently. I believe she was in Munich. EDIT #1292: Someone asked whether she is still active today. Yes, yes she is. From her website: > Petra Maria Mede is an actress, writer, producer, director and standup comic based in New York City since"
67,"### Human: Who is Gilberto José Rodríguez Orejuela?
 ### Assistant: He was a drug lord in Colombia. In 1976, he and his brother were the first to start producing cocaine from the Cali Cartel (which would later become one of the most powerful cartels). They started out as small time dealers but their business grew into something big enough that they became millionaires by age 20. By the mid-80s, they had amassed over $5 billion dollars worth of assets. The two brothers were arrested after an FBI sting operation which involved them using fake passports with false names. After being convicted on money laundering charges, both brothers served long prison sentences at ADX Florence Supermax Prison in Colorado until September 4th, 2013 when they walked free thanks to a plea bargain. Their story inspired the movie ""Blow"" where Johnny Depp plays Pablo Escobar's partner George Jung who was also imprisoned for smuggling drugs into America. Edit - I just realized this question has already been asked twice before so feel free to remove my answer if you want! EDIT 2 - As /u/RugerLover pointed out below there are other questions about him too such as . So we should really get rid of mine now :) edit 3 - My bad, it seems like OP meant someone else entirely... This thread can be closed now please? Thanks everyone! Edit 4 - It looks like all these threads have been merged together so everything should be fine now :) Edit 5 - Someone edited my post saying they weren't sure what they wanted to know anymore lol. Hopefully that helps clear things up though? Edit 6 - Another comment says that the answer needs more detail since people don't understand how much money they made or why they got sentenced. Well, I think the reason they went down wasn't because they made too much money (although they did make millions) but rather due to the fact that they used fake identities while doing illegal activities. That kind of thing could land anyone behind bars no matter how rich they might otherwise be. Edit 7 - Lastly, someone asks whether or not they actually worked with Escobar himself. To put it simply yes; however, according to Wikipedia , ""their relationship ended acrimoniously"". Also note that although Rodriguez was originally thought to be responsible for killing many rival gang members during his reign as kingpin (including some high profile assass"
68,"### Human: What is Ashland?
 ### Assistant: I live in the city of ashland, oregon. It's a small college town that sits on the border with california and has been pretty much completely taken over by the university. The streets are lined with bars, restaurants, coffee shops etc... There are no real businesses here besides the uni itself which also owns most of the land surrounding it. My advice would be to avoid this place if you can help it. Its very expensive for what little there is to do. If your planning a trip here make sure its during summer break so you don't have to deal with students. During spring/fall semester it gets packed out here like crazy as everyone goes home at once and then comes back all together again. That being said we love our university (go raiders!) but I still wouldn't recommend coming here unless absolutely necessary.

 ### Assistant: I'm not sure if you mean ""Who is he?"" or what. But here are some quick facts from Wikipedia, which seems to be a good source for this guy (although there isn't much information on him):  Born in England as Charles Edward Bennell. He changed his name to Theodore Wilson Harris around the time of WWI. A well-known actor and writer at the time who wrote several plays that were produced by John Gielgud, among others. His most famous work is probably . It won an Oscar nomination for Best Screenplay in 1946. He died in 1970 after suffering complications following surgery for cancer. Hopefully someone else can chime in with more details! Edit: Added year of birth/death Edit2: Added more detail about film career. And no one has mentioned yet but he also directed a few films including . Edit3: I forgot to mention , another play written by Harris, which starred Alec Guinness in its original production and went onto become quite popular. Also edited title since it seemed ambiguous before. EDIT5: Thanks again to /u/Bryan_Cranston for adding more info on Harris's life. Here's hoping we get even more input on him soon! EDIT6: You know how sometimes when you ask a question you just want something simple like 'who?' Or maybe you really do need a detailed biography. In any case, thanks everyone for your help so far!

71,"### Human: What was SummerSlam (2016)?
 ### Assistant: The 3rd largest PPV in WWE history. It had the highest buyrate for a non-WrestleMania event since Wrestlemania XXX, which means it made more money than any other show except WMs XXIX and XLIII. For those who don't know what that is...it's basically the Superbowl of professional wrestling. And you should be excited about this because WWE has been having some pretty bad ratings lately. This show beat out every single Raw episode from last year by at least half a million viewers, as well as most episodes of Smackdown Live! during its first few months on air. They also announced two new champions: Naomi won her first ever Women's Championship match against Charlotte Flair, while Kevin Owens retained his Universal Title over Seth Rollins after interference from Chris Jericho & Roman Reigns. Both were huge upsets considering how much they've dominated their respective divisions recently but I think these changes will really help boost attendance going forward so long story short if you like watching people fight each other then definitely check out this years edition next time around too :) EDIT: Here are all three matches listed below just in case anyone wants to watch them again or something? ;)  - Kevin Owens vs Sami Zayn - Neville vs Enzo Amore/Big Cass - AJ Styles vs John Cena Thanks guys!!

72,"### Human: Who was King of England from 8 June 1042 AD to 4 January 1066?
 ### Assistant: Edward the Confessor, who is also the last Anglo-Saxon king. His mother Emma had married Ethelred II (the Unready) and then his half brother Harold Godwinson after her first husband's death in 1035. She died while he was still a child so it wasn't until she remarried that he became King. He was crowned on Christmas Day when he turned twelve - the minimum age for kings at the time. Aged just over fifty years old at his death in 1066, Edward left no children but two illegitimate ones by Edith Swan Neck. The throne went to William I of Normandy. This period marks the end of English independence as we know it today. Edit; sorry forgot to include dates! :D Edit edit; spelling mistake :) EDIT EDIT; spelling error. Sorry again :( Edit edit edit; fixed another typo ^^ Edit edit edit; thanks for all your answers guys/gals, they have been really helpful! :) TL;DR Edward the Confessor ruled England between 8th June 1042AD & 4th Jan 1066AD. He didn't leave any legitimate offspring which led to the Norman Conquest. Thanks everyone :) /u/Wolvelyn I've edited my original post with some more information you might find interesting ;) Let me know if there are anymore questions or anything else I can add! Cheers xxx Edit edit edit; one final thing...I should probably point out that this question has already been answered before here . If anyone wants to see how these threads work please check it out too. It contains lots of useful info about what kind of sources people use etc :) Best wishes Wolvesyxo 🐺Edit edit edit edit; Just noticed something. You don't need to be an expert historian to answer this question. It would help if you were aware of certain key facts though such as ""Edward III"" being the nickname given to him due to his father being called Edward the Exile. Also, the Battle of Hastings took place during October not September :) Cheers xxx Edit edit edit edit; Thankyou thankyou thankyou!!! I am doing research into medieval history for a GCSE coursework and i needed to find out exactly who was ruling England at the time of the battle of hastings..and you helped me!! And im only"
73,"### Human: Who was Józef Grudzień?
 ### Assistant: He is the first Polish person to win a Nobel Prize in Physics. I don't know anything about his life, but you can find out more here  Edit: spelling and formatting. Also added some links from the wikipedia article. Hope this helps! :) EDIT2: Here are two other articles that have been written recently on him as well (they are not perfect translations):   , by Piotr Kulczycki of . And another one : ) EDIT3: A commenter posted these links which seem very good too: , and especially ! Edit4: Another link with lots of information on his life has been submitted below. It seems like he lived quite an interesting life. Thanks everyone for your help! Edit5: The last post has also provided me with a new lead to follow up on so it will probably be deleted soon after. Edit6: Fixed a typo thanks /u/johnny_brown ;-) Edit7: Updated all previous links because they were broken due to the ELI5 subreddit being down for maintenance. Sorry if anyone missed them. They should work now though ;) Edited again to add even better sources; thanks u/BalticSlavicGuy :-) Edit8: Added a third source. This time it is actually my own blog where I wrote a bit about Grudzien and the history of Poland during WWII. Thanks to u/lucas0915 who pointed it out! Edit9: More great comments below. Thank you! If someone wants to write a proper answer, please do - there are still tons of things we could learn about this man. Edit10: So many answers already... I think this thread deserves its own sticky. I am going to leave it open until further notice. Please keep posting your questions and comments about Grudzien or any other physicist that won the Nobel prize. Edit11: We need a moderator to pin this thread. Otherwise it might get lost among all the others. Someone who knows how to do it, please step forward. TLDR: No one really knows much about Józef Grudzień apart from what little information can be found online. However, he did live through extremely tumultuous times when Poland had only just regained independence and then fought against Nazi Germany before eventually falling under Soviet occupation. His biography would make a fascinating read indeed! Edit12: As promised, I finally finished"
74,"### Human: Who is the god of water and the sea in ancient Roman religion and mythology?
 ### Assistant: Neptune. He was also a protector of horses, so he's sometimes called ""Neptune Equester."" The Romans had an entire temple to him on the Campus Martius (their version of our Capitol Hill), where they kept his statue and held rituals honoring him. They even built statues of him at their ports for protection against stormy seas when ships were leaving port! Edit: spelling Edit 2: I just remembered that Jupiter was also considered a deity who could control weather events like rain and thunderstorms. So it wasn't uncommon for people to pray to both gods if there was going to be some kind of severe weather event coming up. But since Jupiter would have been more associated with the sky itself rather than specific parts of nature, you wouldn't see as many images or depictions of him interacting directly with things like trees or rivers. That makes sense right? There are two gods doing essentially the same thing but one has much less interaction with the earth/land than the other does...so we don't expect them to look alike all the time. Also - if anyone wants me to answer any follow-up questions about this topic please let me know :) Thanks everyone! This question really got my brain working today. EDIT: Forgot to add that Mars too had something similar to the role of Neptune. Like Neptune, he controlled floods and droughts. And again, he was often depicted riding into battle astride a chariot pulled by warhorses. It seems like every major god had some sort of connection to either the land or the ocean. The Greeks didn't do quite as well though. Zeus and Poseidon seemingly only shared one attribute between each other; lightning bolts. Though maybe Hades should count since he ruled over the underworld which is below ground level. All the rest seemed pretty disconnected from those aspects of life. Oh yeah - Venus was another exception because she ruled love and beauty, not natural forces. She doesn't get along very well with Juno though since Juno rules marriage while Venus controls romance. As someone else said earlier though, these days we think of her as being related to sex instead of beauty due to how modern culture views sexuality. In Rome, however, she was seen primarily as being beautiful and having a perfect body shape. The idea"
75,"### Human: Who is Booker T. Jones?
 ### Assistant: The founder of the Stax Records label, and member/leader of the MGs as well as being a pretty good solo artist in his own right. He was also an early collaborator with Al Green (although they had different styles). Here's one of my favorite songs from him that I think you might enjoy...  Edit - oops sorry forgot to put up the link for it! It should be working now though :)   EDIT2: Also he has won three Grammys. 1973- Best R&B Song (""Time Is A Healer"") 1986- Best Album Arrangement on ""The Secret Garden"" 1995- Best Pop Instrumental Performance on ""Cruisin'"" (with Steve Cropper)  edit3: And here are some other links if you want more info about him or his music.. Wikipedia page ( ) Wikiquote entry ( ) And here's something else cool, check out this video where he talks about how he got into making records when he was younger.. (He'd been playing piano since age 4.) Hopefully that helps answer your question OP! Sorry I didn't get back to you sooner but there were so many comments coming through at once and I couldn't keep track haha. Edit4: Just found these two videos too which have interviews with BTJ talking about his life in music.. 1st interview part 1 1st interview part 2 2nd interview part 1 2nd interview part 2 Source: I love all kinds of music and have listened to a lot of it over the years. One day while browsing YouTube looking for new stuff to listen to I came across these videos and thought I would share them with anyone who hasn't heard of him before. Cheers! =D Edited to add more sources & information because why not ;) P.S. If any mod wants me to remove anything just let me know please ^^; Thanks everyone :D P.P.S. You can find out more about him by checking out his website , where you will see that he still plays live regularly and even does charity events around the world. That kinda guy rocks ;] . Also, if you go onto Spotify (or iTunes etc...) then search for 'Booker T.' Then scroll down until you reach the song called 'Fast Train'. Click play and wait till you hear"
76,"### Human: Who was Ronald Erwin McNair?
 ### Assistant: He was an astronaut who died on the Challenger. He was a great example of someone with drive and determination, going from being in a low-income household to becoming one of the first African American astronauts.  Edit: I know this is old but it's still relevant as we are celebrating his life today! :) Source: I have been watching space shuttle launches since I was born (1986) so obviously I remember him. It wasn't until much later that I learned about his background though. EDIT2: This post isn't really getting upvotes... Why not? Is there something wrong here or am I missing out on some kinda joke? Not trying to be rude just curious why noone wants to talk about him. :/ EDIT3: Oh wait you guys aren't talking about ""the guy"" he's actually called ""The Great One"". That explains things. Sorry for any confusion. ;) EDIT4: Just realized that the OP didn't say which person they were asking about. So my answer doesn't apply anymore sorry :( Edit5: Well at least you got me to learn more about The Great One. Thanks for your comment and all the other comments too. Sources: Wikipedia:  And lots of random sites googling ""Ronald E. Mcnair"" Edit6: My apologies again if anyone thought I meant The Great One instead of Ronald. It should be obvious now what I mean by referring to them both separately as ""he"", although I can see how people could think otherwise given their similar names. Hopefully this clears everything up. Again sorry for any misunderstanding caused. :) Edit7: I don't want to take away from the discussion either way so please feel free to keep discussing anything related to Ronald vs. The Great One. I will read through it when time permits. :) Edit8: Wow thanks everyone for making such interesting posts and adding info that I never knew before! Definitely helped clear things up for me too. :) Edit9: Ooh wow looks like Ronald had a pretty cool backstory himself too huh? Definitely makes sense why he would inspire others. I hope people continue posting stories and facts about these two men because it has definitely inspired me to research even further into each man individually. :) Edit10: I forgot to mention earlier that I had heard of The Great One previously via"
77,"### Human: What is taurine and where does it come from?
 ### Assistant: Taurines are a class of amino acids. They can be found in nature, but they're more commonly synthesized by the body than derived directly from food sources (I believe). The name comes from their chemical structure; there aren't any other compounds that share this exact formula. It's used for things like brain development during fetal life or to treat conditions such as epilepsy/seizures.  Edit - I just noticed you were asking about dietary intake so here goes! Food items with high amounts include fish meal, meat & poultry trimmings, bone char, feather meals, egg whites etc. So if your dog eats mostly animal products then chances are he'll get enough through his regular diets anyway :) Hope this helps! Source: My biochemistry lecturer :) EDIT2: Found some info on its use in energy drinks... From : > ""Taurine has been shown to improve athletic performance and reduce muscle damage following strenuous exercise."" ""Energy Drinks contain ingredients which increase mental alertness"" ""Athletics and sports require both physical exertion as well as cognitive skills. These demands place stress upon an athlete’s central nervous system. In order to perform at peak levels, many professional athletes take supplements containing caffeine because it enhances focus and increases reaction time."" Also found something interesting about how much we consume compared to what our dogs eat naturally: 10g per day vs 5-8mg daily. Sources:  edit3: Just realized i wrote ""dog"" instead of cat twice lol.... But yeah, hope someone finds my answer useful :) edit4: Fixed source links ;) Thanks OP! This was really fun to write up :) Happy to help! Feel free to ask anything else related though if you want! Cheers ^_^ Edit again: Fixed link typos thanks to /u/JoshuaColeman ! :)   Edit 5: Forgot to mention that it also acts as a neurotransmitter (so it communicates signals between nerve cells) and regulates calcium levels within the cell. I guess these functions would explain why it plays a role in seizure control too..? Not sure tho haha ;p Edit6: Added another article discussing the benefits of using taurine in"
78,"### Human: What was the city that experienced a devastating poison gas attack during the Iran-Iraq War?
 ### Assistant: The only thing I can think of is Halabja. This is also mentioned in . It's hard to find more information on it though, because as far as I know there isn't much publically available about this event. Edit - Found some stuff here  and here   EDIT2 - And apparently it happened again not long ago too!  Here are two articles from CNN: & x200B; & x200B; If anyone has any better links or info please share them with us! :) TL;DR - No one really knows what you mean but if we had to guess then most likely it would be Halabja. But since we don't have any further evidence than Wikipedia, etc... no one can say for sure. Also just to add, the reason why people aren't searching around trying to answer your question (or at least they weren't when I posted) could be due to the fact that you didn't include the country name in your post title. As such, someone who wasn't aware of the conflict wouldn't even see these posts unless they knew enough about history/the war already to search specifically for ""poisonous gas"" attacks within certain time periods. So yeah, that might be part of the problem as well :P EDIT3 - Just found another article on Halabja which states that according to witnesses 5000 were killed by Saddam Hussein's forces. Not quite sure how accurate that number is however so take it with a grain of salt. EDIT4 - Okay, after looking through the first link in my edit above I realized something interesting. One of the sources says that the Iraqi army used mustard gas against Kurds living near Kirkuk in May 1987. Now if this is true, does anyone else remember reading anything about that particular incident? I thought that all gassing incidents between both sides took place prior to Operation Desert Storm? Or am I mistaken? Either way, if anyone has anymore insight into this topic feel free to chime in! EDIT5 - Well turns out I actually do recall seeing something about this before. In the book , there is an account of a guy named David McDermott who went to Iraq to try and get his friend back alive. He ended up getting caught himself and tortured extensively until he signed papers saying he wanted to defect to Iraq. After being imprisoned for over"
79,"### Human: Who was Holly Dunn?
 ### Assistant: She is a country singer. I'm not sure if she ever had any hits or whatnot but her song ""Daddy's Hands"" (which sounds like it should be about the 1986 Challenger explosion) has always been my favorite. It's got some deep lyrics and an amazing voice, even though you can tell that this isn't exactly where she made her name in music. The best part of the whole thing is when they show pictures of dads holding their kids while she sings at the end. Some are very old and frail looking men with young children who look to have just entered puberty. Others were much younger and looked as if they could still play football on Sunday afternoon after work without breaking into too much of a sweat. There aren't many people alive today whose fathers died before them so seeing these photos really hit home for me. Edit: For those interested here is one such picture from the video.   And another . EDIT2: This thread inspired me to dig up more info on Ms. Dunn herself. Turns out she wrote ""Brand New Key"", which was later covered by Melanie. You may remember her as being the girl who sang ""Look What They Done To My Song Ma"". But there is also a ton of other stuff written by her. Her biggest success came in the late '70s/early-mid '80s. Here is a link to all of her songs.   If anyone wants to know anything else let me know. Also if someone would like to write something more comprehensive than myself please do!    EDIT3: In response to comments below, yes indeed there is a Wikipedia page for Holly Dunn. Unfortunately it doesn't contain nearly enough information regarding her career. It only mentions three singles that charted in Billboard Hot Country Songs, two of which did reach #5. All three peaked within the same week during April 1984, however none reached higher than #5. Furthermore her album ""Sunshine and Roses"" didn't crack the top ten albums list nor did any single off of it make the charts. As far as awards go, she won a Grammy Award in 1985 for Best Female Country Vocal Performance (""You Really Had Me Goin'"" ). That year she was nominated again for Record Of The Year (""Blue Rose Is""). From what little research I"
80,"### Human: What is the appearance of the Japanese dwarf flying squirrel?
 ### Assistant: I'm not sure if this helps or confuses things. They are indeed very small, but they have a thick tail that looks like it could be used for gliding and/or as an extra limb to help them climb trees (similarly to how some primates use their tails). Their fur color varies from black-ish brown to gray-white depending on where you find them in Japan.  The picture below shows what they look like without all of their fuzzy hairs. You can see more pictures here . Edit: spelling errors corrected, added information about their body shape. Hopefully someone else who knows more than me will post something with better photos! :) Edit again: fixed formatting issues. I hope no one minds my taking over your thread, OP...but I was just curious enough by these creatures to do so. EDIT THREE TIMES: Added link to article explaining why we don't know much about them yet. Edit four times: removed ""Edit three times"" because it makes it sound like there were only two edits before this one when there were actually four. Also changed title slightly because OP didn't seem to understand what I meant by ""appearance."" Sorry for being confusing :( Edit five time: Fixed spelling error. Edit six time: Fixed another spelling error. Edit seven time: Spelled out ""body shape"". Edit eight time: Removed unnecessary words to make sentence shorter. Edit nine time: Replaced ""body shape"" with ""physical form"", which sounds less awkward. Edit ten time: Edited last line to clarify that they aren't known well yet despite having been discovered recently. Edit eleven time: Changed wording of first paragraph to avoid saying they are unknown when they clearly exist. Edit twelve time: Added a link to an interesting scientific journal paper discussing whether or not these animals should even be considered separate species. It talks about how they are found in different regions throughout Japan, which may mean that they evolved separately due to geographical isolation. This would explain why they appear so different from each other based solely upon physical characteristics. Edit thirteen time: Added info about their location within Japan. Apparently they live near rivers and lakes, including rice paddies. Edit fourteenth time: Added image showing their habitat range. It seems like they are mostly restricted to areas around Tokyo though - at least according to Google Maps. Edit fifteenth time: Deleted"
81,"### Human: Who is Tove Lo and what is her background?
 ### Assistant: She's a Swedish singer. Her real name is Ebba Tove Elsa Nilsson but she changed it to be more ""rock n roll"" sounding when starting out in the music business (she also has tattoos of a gun, knife, spider etc). 1st single was ""Habits"". Here are some links for you:   - Her website/blog    - Wikipedia page     - Soundcloud   - YouTube channel     - Spotify playlist   Hope that helps :) Edit: Also I just realized she sounds kinda like Pink... weird coincidence! EDIT2: Oh wow here we go again with people who think they can post random comments without knowing anything about something... The song Habit was released in October last year, so yes there will be other songs by now. But most importantly this thread isn't supposed to be about how great her new album is or whatever, its supposed to be an introduction to someone who doesn't know much about her at all. If you want to talk about her new stuff then start your own comment or PM me if you really have no clue why anyone would ask questions on Reddit about her. Thanks everyone else for being helpful though :) Edit3: Someone asked why I'm posting from my phone... Well because I've got nothing better going on right now lol ;) And yeah I don't mind answering any follow up questions either :D Edit4: It seems like you guys prefer asking about artists instead of reading their bios yourself.. So okay let's do this shall we. What did you find interesting about her bio? Didn't see many replies yet :( I guess I should make another post explaining things further since it seemed like nobody actually read her biography themselves before coming back to complain about not finding information anywhere online. > The first time she ever performed live was on stage as part of hip hop band Nasty Idols, where she went under the alias Tigerlily. Her debut EP Truth Serum was released later that same year. In April 2012, Lo signed to Island Records UK. She started working on her full-length studio album Love Ballads, which features collaborations with Max Martin, Savan Kotecha, Albin Nedler, Cory Enemy, Alexander Gustafsson and Ludvig Söderberg. In December 2013, she announced plans to release two separate albums; one"

 ### Assistant: He received it posthumously, in 1943 for his actions during the Battle of Guadalcanal on September 20th-26th, 1942. His citation reads: ""For distinguished conduct in action against enemy Japanese forces while serving as a platoon leader with Company H, 3d Battalion, 7th Marines, 1st Marine Division (Reinforced), Fleet Marine Force, in connection with combat operations against enemy Japanese forces at Guadalcanal Island, Solomon Islands from 20 to 25 September 1942."" The full text can be found here . Hope this helps! Edit: I've also added more context about him personally, which should help too :) EDIT again: Sorry - I accidentally posted twice...I think my computer is possessed by evil spirits or something. Thanks for fixing that up, /u/Browse_the_web !  Edit #3: It seems like there are a lot of questions regarding specifics so I thought I would add some more information. This page has a good overview of how the medal system works , including info on eligibility requirements and other details. I don't have time right now to look through all of those pages but if you do find any useful links feel free to share them in comments! Edit #4: Here's another one that might answer your question better than mine does :   Let me know if anything still needs clarifying though; I'm happy to try and answer whatever follow ups come along ^^ Edit #5: Finally, just because it sounds interesting, here's an account written by someone who served under Capt. Jackson:  Edit #6: Well well well..looks like we need yet ANOTHER edit today ;) Apparently there were two Arhtur Jacksons awarded Medals Of Honour (not sure why they gave out two different ones).

83,"### Human: Who is Edward Snowden and what did he do?
 ### Assistant: He was a contractor for the NSA. The job of this agency is to collect information about foreign countries, people in those countries who might be spies or terrorists etc. So they were basically doing their jobs. Snowden got access to all these files that contained names and details on lots of Americans. These are not really criminals but just normal citizens whose data was stored there by mistake I guess. So now he has given out this info to journalists so it can get into the public domain. Now anyone with an internet connection will know if any of them live near you. This makes me feel very uncomfortable as my neighbors could easily have been put under surveillance without knowing anything about it. Is this legal? Doesn't seem like it to me... Edit: also - If you want more info check out /u/LemmingsMind post here . He explains things much better than i am able to! EDIT2: Also another interesting read from u/GodOfThunder510  (I love his name) which talks about how he thinks we should deal with leakers in general. EDIT3: Another good thread discussing why snowden shouldn't face charges.   EDIT4: Finally some good news! It seems like Obama wants to change the laws regarding whistle blowers! That means no one would go through what Snowden had to endure again. Great stuff! EDIT5: Here's the link to the actual bill being proposed.    EDIT6: Looks like the bill is going ahead, although I don't think its passed yet. But thats great news nonetheless! EDIT7: Well, looks like the bill didn't pass.. but I hope it does soon! EDIT8: Still nothing happening :( EDIT9: Looks like there still isn't enough support to make this law happen.. lets keep hoping :) EDIT10: Looks like there may finally be some progress towards passing the Whistleblower Protection Act of 2014. Hopefully it passes before too long though! EDIT11: Woo hoo!! Passed today. Good times :D EDIT12: Someone else posted this comment earlier. Its actually quite funny and made me laugh : > In other words, someone at Booz Allen Hamilton found out Snowden was downloading terabytes of classified documents every night onto thumb drives and leaving them around hotels where guests could see him using"
84,"### Human: Who was Kenneth ""Ken"" Snow?
 ### Assistant: Ken Snow is a Canadian photographer who has worked for National Geographic, Smithsonian Magazine and the New York Times. He also teaches at UBC's School of Journalism in Vancouver as an adjunct professor. I don't know if he'll be able to answer your question but you might want to check out his . It looks like it could have some good information on him. Also here are a couple of articles from The Globe & Mail that discuss how much money he made taking photos while working with Nat Geo. 1.  2.  3. Edit: Here is another article by CTV news about Mr. Snow. Hope this helps! EDIT: Another link talking about his work: 4.   5. 6. 7. And finally, one last time... 8. 9. EDIT AGAIN: Here's a video interview done between Ken Snow and Dr. David Suzuki (yes, THAT David Suzuki) where they talk about polar bear photography. Source: 10. You can see more images from Ken Snow's archive here: , 11. Here's a photo taken during one of their shoots together: 12. Here's an old clip of them doing interviews together back when they were both teaching at Ryerson University: 13. And just because....here's my favourite picture of all-time: 14. 15. That should do it :) Thanks for reading! If there's anything else anyone wants me to find or look into please let me know. Good luck!Edit again: Here's something interesting. Apparently Mr. Snow used to own the rights to the image above. However, after making millions off its use, he sold those rights to the creator of the book itself, Michael Stipe. This would explain why the image appears so often nowadays without any credit being given to Mr. Snow. As far as I know though, no royalties have been paid since then. Here's a link to the story: 16. 17. Edit once again: Here's another article written about Mr. Snow and his work: 18. 19. Edit yet again: Here's an older article featuring Mr. Snow. 20. Lastly, here's a great quote from him: > I think we’re losing our ability to tell"
85,"### Human: Who was George Mraz?
 ### Assistant: I believe he was a Czechoslovakian-born pianist. He played in the early 1980s at the same time as Vladimir Ashkenazy and Martha Argerich, among others. He had his own style of playing that sounded like it came from another planet (i.e., not Russian or German). One of my favorite pieces is ""The Seventh Door"" by Janacek which has a slow opening section followed by an incredibly fast middle section with lots of runs on both hands and then back to the beginning for one last run through before ending. In this piece there are two sections where you can't tell what key your going into until about halfway through each so when you start hearing the first notes of these passages you don't know if they will go upward or downward but once you get used to them it becomes obvious. Here is some footage of him performing it live!  Edit: Oops...forgot the link....here ya go:  It also sounds great on YouTube without all the background noise. EDIT2: Fixed broken links. Sorry guys..I guess YT changed their URLs again. :( edit3: And here is his performance of Chopin's Scherzo B minor Opus 54 No. 2:  Again no audio available online yet due to copyright issues. Hopefully someone else knows how we could embed audio from other websites onto our posts here on Reddit. That would be awesome!!! :) EDIT4: Found more videos of Mr. Mraz.....Here is his performance of Beethoven Sonata #7 (""Waldstein"") movement 2:  Another video showing off his technique/talent is his performance of Debussy's Estampes Book II:  And finally his interpretation of Scriabins Etude Tableau No. 6 Opus 39 No. 6:  If anyone knows who I should contact to post audio files directly to reddit please let me know. I think its a pretty cool idea. Thanks!! :) Edit5: Lastly here is his performance of Brahmss Piano Concerto No. 1 Movement III Allegro Ritmico:   I have never heard anything quite like any of those performances above. Very unique interpretations and excellent technical skill. A true master of piano. I hope everyone enjoys listening to these recordings just as much as I did finding"
86,"### Human: Who was Galileo Galilei and what is he most remembered for?
 ### Assistant: He's the father of modern physics. His work with telescopes led to a better understanding of the universe around us, including our own solar system. It also laid the foundation for Isaac Newton who came up with his theory of gravity (which later proved correct). But more than that, it paved the way for Kepler who formulated laws about planetary motion which would eventually be used by Newton as well. Without all this stuff we wouldn't have any space probes or rockets. No moon landings! Or satellites in orbit! And no Apollo missions either. Edit: I should point out that Galileo himself did not believe that the Earth revolved around the Sun - instead he believed both were stationary. This viewpoint got him into trouble when he published books on helio-centrism without permission from the church. The Catholic Church at the time held to an earth centered model because they felt it supported their religious beliefs. They thought if you accepted a sun based universe then there could be multiple gods. If God created everything else why couldn't he create other planets too? You might think that sounds like nonsense but remember that back then religion played a much larger role in people lives compared to today. Also remember that Copernicus didn't publish anything until after he died so many others had been thinking along these lines before Galileo ever wrote a book. So while some may credit him for discovering things about the Universe, its really just another example of how science builds upon itself. 150 years earlier Copernicus said ""hey lets put the Sun where it makes sense"" and everyone ignored him. Then Galileo says ""hey lets put the Moon where it makes sense"" and everyone ignores him again. Next comes Tycho Brahe who actually does observations and measurements and discovers that the newest theories are right. Finally comes Johannes Keplar who takes those ideas one step further. Now everybody can agree that the Earth moves around the Sun even though it took hundreds of years. The same thing happened with the Big Bang Theory. People started talking about it long ago but nobody cared till Einstein came up with General Relativity and showed them exactly how wrong they were. After that people finally paid attention. In short, scientists build off eachother's work and make incremental progress over decades/century. Its only recently that we've begun taking large leaps forward thanks to computers and vast"
87,"### Human: What is Dalby Forest known for?
 ### Assistant: It's a forest. There are many in the UK, but this one has some nice features and trails that make it popular with tourists. I have no idea why you would ask this question on reddit though...? Edit - also, it's not called ""Dalby"", its just pronounced like that by locals because of the way they say their L's (i.e. it sounds more like Dah-bee). If someone from Yorkshire says ""Dahlb"" to me then we will get into an argument about how stupid people outside yorkshire sound! 😂 EDIT2 - Also, i live next door so if anyone wants any info please feel free to PM or post here :) Edit3 - And yes, there was once a village called 'Dalby'. But it wasn't where the forest is now, it used to be much further south towards Pickering/Malton area. The name survives as a place name today, such as Dalby Forest, Dalby High Street etc. 👍🏻 EDIT4 - A few other places around the world use the same spelling / pronunciation too, e.g.: Dalby Island, Queensland Australia; Dalby Township, Illinois USA; Dalby River, Western Cape South Africa; Dalby Town Hall, Brisbane City Council, Queensland Australia. So it isn't unique to us. EDIT5 - One thing worth mentioning which hasn't been mentioned yet - This forest is part of the North York Moors National Park, and therefore it's protected land. You can't go cutting down trees willy nilly like you could in most parts of England! So don't think of it as just another forest, although it does look similar at first glance. EDIT6 - More interesting facts about Dalby Forest (in my opinion): 1) Dalby Forest is home to the largest single collection of oak trees in Europe. They were planted by the Victorians back in the mid 1800s, after they had cut all the original native woodland out. 2) In 1978, 60% of Dalby Forest burnt down due to arson attacks. Many local businesses suffered huge financial losses during the clean up operation afterwards, and the owners blamed environmental protest groups who wanted to stop the clearance of the remaining natural woods nearby."
88,"### Human: What is a sachet d'épices and how is it used?
 ### Assistant: It’s not something you use. It means “spice packet”. So, for example, if someone says they bought some sausages with the sachets of mustard on them that means there was an individual packet containing mustard powder in each packaged sausage. The term has nothing to do with spicy food or anything like that. I hope this helps! :) Edit: Thanks /u/Taco_Lobster for the correction (I guessed wrong). But thanks also to u/Muddypaws for helping me out by adding more context around what my comment meant :-) Edit 2: Oh wait... I think I got it backwards again. Sorry about that. In fact, according to , these packets are called ""capsules"" rather than ""sachets"". This makes sense because capsule sounds more medical-like whereas sachet just doesn't sound quite right when referring to little plastic bags. Anyway - sorry for any confusion caused here! ;-) EDIT3: Oops! Just noticed that OP asked specifically about ""SACHET D’ÉPICES"", so now we have another source saying that those things ARE actually called SACHET D'EPÍCES (with a capital E), which kinda proves my point anyway lol. Apologies for all the edits but I wanted to make sure people understood what I originally said even though I clearly had no idea myself :P And thank you both for correcting me as well :-D Source: 1) Google Translate 2) Wikipedia 3) Trip Advisor France Forum  4) Mistral Travel Blog 5) Lonely Planet Guidebook 6) WikiTravel (French wiki version) 7) French Wikipedia page on Capsules 8) French forum post about mustard sachets from 2009 9) French website listing different types of capsules 10) French blog post about capsules (in English!) 11) French travel guide book mentioning capsules 12) French website explaining why capsules were invented & their history 13) More information about capsules in general (in English) 14) Website dedicated entirely to capsules 15) Another website discussing capsules 16) Someone who uses capsules for medication in his daily life explains everything very nicely including the differences between various kinds of caps"
89,"### Human: Who was Idanell Brill Connally?
 ### Assistant: She is the wife of John B. Connelly, a Texas businessman and politician who served as Governor from 1963 to 1970 and US Secretary of Defense under President Richard Nixon (and resigned in disgrace after Watergate). I'm not sure if she ever held public office herself but they were married for over fifty years until her death last year at age ninety-five. Edit: spelling. Edit2: more information on Mrs. Connally. Edit3: still more info!  Also , which has some interesting photos. edit4: one final link - . It's a brief biography of Mrs. Conley by the Houston Chronicle. Edit5: This thread deserves an update because it turns out that she did serve briefly as mayor of Austin during the period when her husband was governor. And here are some links about her life with JBC.  I found this article quite interesting -  - and there have been several threads discussing their relationship. Here are two posts from /u/Tlaloc_Humanity.   The first post contains the text of ""The Day They Shot At Me,"" a speech given by Mr. Connolly shortly before his death. It's worth reading in full; he gives credit where due, including mentioning the role played by Mrs. Conelly in helping him through the ordeals following the assassination attempt. The second post includes a followup letter written by Senator Connellly to LBJ expressing appreciation for help received while he recuperated. Again, you should read both letters in full. TLDR: She supported her husband throughout his political career and helped him recover physically and emotionally after the assassination attempt. In fact, according to the author of the latter article linked above, he didn't even know what had happened until he woke up later that night. As mentioned earlier, she also served as Mayor of Austin for six months early in her husbands tenure as Governor. For those interested in learning more about the events surrounding Kennedy's assassination, I highly recommend watching the PBS documentary series ""American Experience"" episode titled ""Five Days That Changed America."" It can be viewed online via Amazon Prime Video. If you don't subscribe to Amazon Prime, then you might check your local library. Many libraries carry DVD copies of the episodes. Or better yet, watch it free on"
90,"### Human: What is the population density of Plummer, Idaho?
 ### Assistant: The 2015 US census gives a residential count for that town as 469. This would make it about .8 people per square mile or just over one person per every 17 acres (the size of an average American football field). That's pretty dense by rural standards but not nearly as high as some other small towns in America like . I lived in Pocatello and drove through there on occasion so I know what you mean when you say ""it seems to be spread out"". It really isn't very big at all. Hope this helps! EDIT: Fixed link to . Sorry 'bout dat. :D EDIT: One more thing - I should mention that while it may seem strange to see a town with only 469 residents having its own Wikipedia article , they have been around since before statehood. They were incorporated back in 1903 which makes them almost exactly twice as old as California itself. So yeah...they are definitely still alive and kicking. :) Edit #2: In addition to their own wiki page, Google Maps also has street view imagery from inside Plummer proper if anyone wants to take a look.  edit #3: Here's another fun factoid; the first mayor of Plummer was none other than Frank Church himself! Talk about local politics being intertwined with national affairs eh? ;) Edit #4: And here we go again folks....another interesting tidbit regarding our friends up north. According to the latest Census data available online, the median income for a household within city limits in Plummer sits right smack dab between $20k-$30k annually. Not too bad considering how much land area they cover compared to other cities across America. However, keep in mind that these figures do NOT include any agricultural properties outside those boundaries because they don't receive electricity or sewage services via public utilities companies either way. Those kinds of things tend towards higher end homes anyway though so maybe someone living off grid wouldn't care too much about such amenities regardless. On top of everything else mentioned above though? If ever wanted proof positive evidence showing us why small communities matter even today despite modern society telling otherwise then perhaps now might actually BE THE perfect time to visit yourself someday soon enough..because let me tell ya--you won't regret taking advantage once given half chance opportunity present itself along said path forward moving ahead further"

 ### Assistant: It was released last year. The actual name of it, as I recall, was ""Killing Kennedy.""  If you have cable or satellite TV service, they probably still show it from time to time (I know that mine does). EDIT: Just looked up when it premiered - March 3rd, 2013. You can see if your provider has a listing for it by going here .  Edit #2: Here are some pictures from the set in case anyone wants them...

92,"### Human: What is a bistro and what kind of food do they serve?
 ### Assistant: I'm not sure why people are getting so hung up on the definition. A ""bistro"" (or, more accurately in this case, a ""brasserie"") is simply a restaurant serving cheap but tasty meals that you can eat with your hands. It could be anything from sandwiches to fried chicken or burgers to sausages to pasta dishes. The idea is that it should be quick and easy, good quality stuff for reasonable prices. In France there was an association called Bistronomies which promoted restaurants like these - they were basically the equivalent of a gastro-pub here in England. If someone tells you their place is a brassiere/bistro, just assume they mean something similar to those things. There isn't really any need to get into whether it has a specific menu etc because if someone says they have a ""bistro"", we all know roughly what they mean by that term! Also, as far as I understand it, when French people use the word ""restaurant"" they usually don't include bars in that category; they tend to think of them as being different places altogether. So it may well be true that some American restauranteurs call themselves a bar & grill instead of saying pub, even though both terms would probably translate over. But then again, I might be wrong about that... Edit: spelling mistakes :P edit 2: grammar :) And thanks for the gold everyone! ^_^ EDIT3: Thanks for the comments guys, much appreciated. This thread will always remain one of my favourites ever made on Reddit since its such a nice little example of how language works and how important it is to define words properly before discussing them ;) EDIT4: You know what else is funny? Whenever I try typing the word ""bistro"" out loud I end up writing ""baristo"". I wonder where THAT came from.... EDIT5: I love learning languages! ;D EDIT6: > 1) Is there a difference between 'Brasserie', 'Bistro' and 'Resto' in France? Nope, at least none worth mentioning. Those are pretty much interchangeable. As said above, ""bistro"" means essentially fast food served without cutlery while ""restos"" are fancy sit down type affairs. They're all very broad categories though. For instance, most ""bistrons"" also sell alcoholic drinks"
93,"### Human: Who is Jennie Trinidad Fernando Kwan?
 ### Assistant: I'm a fan of her music and she seems like an awesome person. She also has an awesome name! But who the hell are you talking about? :D Edit: I don't know why my phone doesn't let me edit posts after 2 minutes, but it was just a typo on the last letter in ""Kwan."" My bad. ;) Edit #3: Oh wait...I get it now. The post title says ""Jennifer Tran"" instead of ""Trinidad,"" which would make more sense if the OP were actually referring to Jenni Rivera or something. So yeah...sorry for any confusion that caused. :) Edit #4: And this time I got it right. Lol. Edit #5: Nope, still not getting it. > Jenny Trinidad Fernando Kwan is the only woman ever to have won all three major beauty pageants; Miss Universe (1968), Miss World (1970) & Miss International (1971). Wowzers!! What a talent!!! That sounds impressive. Good find there, u/sir_napsalot. :) Now THAT'S what we call ""The Total Package!"" ;-) Edit #6: Wait....what?? It wasn't even JENNIFER TRINIDAD FERNANDO KWAN??? This isn't some weird joke by someone pretending they know who she is when really they DON'T know who she is at all? Sweet Jesus, how did no one else catch this before NOW?! There must be some kind of glitch with your browser. :( Well, hopefully it'll come back up eventually. In the meantime, here's a link so you can check out exactly who /u/sir_napsalot was trying to tell us about: . Edit #7: Ok, ok, ok.....I GOT IT NOW! Hahaha. Holy crap, I feel dumb as shit now.

94,"### Human: Who was Séamus Patrick Pattison?
 ### Assistant: He is the Irishman who jumped off of the Empire State Building in 1932. His suicide note read ""I'm sorry to do this, but I can't go on living like a rat."" He landed safely and survived for two hours before being pronounced dead at hospital. You can see his death certificate here . The story goes that he had been working as an elevator operator there and lost everything when the Wall Street Crash happened. But it turns out that he actually worked in maintenance and hadn't even seen inside the building until after he applied. So what did drive him over the edge? Well, we don't know exactly. There were rumours about a girlfriend or wife (or both) who left him which may have played some part - although they weren't true. Or maybe it really was just money worries... Either way, you can say goodbye to one of historys most famous leap-to-death stories with no mystery attached! Edit: Fixed links thanks /u/drygulch! Edit again: And fixed another link thanks /u/Jim_in_Houston! Thanks guys :) Edit yet again: Fixed more broken links thanks /u/BanditKing64 & /u/cobalt500 ! Thanks people ;) Edit once more: Fixed all remaining links thanks /u/CptnAhab & /u/ChaosFanatix! Thanks everyone :D Edited once more: Added extra info from the comments below by /u/Lord_of_the_Moon! Thanks matey! EDITED AGAIN: Added further information provided by u/johnnybear87 , u/ViolentEndings & u/SirGalahad1597 ! Thanks chaps! EDIT YET ONCE MORE: Finally added the correct date of birth for Mr Pattison according to u/CraigGregory1965 's comment too! It wasn't until I started writing my first book that I discovered how much work went into these posts so I hope you appreciate them anyway :) Cheers folks! PS. I've also updated this post every time I found new evidence since then so if any other historians want to add anything else feel free! Edit yer bladdy arse off! Edit: Fixed spelling mistakes"
95,"### Human: What happens to the body during starvation?
 ### Assistant: The human body is designed for a constant supply of food. When there's no more, it enters into survival mode and will start eating itself in order to stay alive. It also starts breaking down muscle tissue (for energy) because you can only use fat as fuel when your carbohydrate stores are gone. This leads to weakness and eventually death if not treated. TL;DR - You die from hunger or malnutrition-related diseases. EDIT: I think someone mentioned this already but... If you were living off land that had plenty of game/fish then you could eat some animals too which would keep you going longer than just plants. But most people don't live like that so they'd have to resort to other sources of calories such as insects etc. EDIT 2: Also forgot about . Basically, when your blood sugar levels drop low enough (due to lack of glucose), your brain releases dopamine causing feelings of euphoria & happiness. Edit 3: Added /u/Sir_Tacitus 's link to an article on how starving yourself makes sense evolutionarily speaking since we evolved over millions of years where famines weren't uncommon at all. So our bodies adapted accordingly by becoming efficient hunters who know exactly what kinda nutrients their prey has been consuming before making them dinner ;) Edit 4: Forgot to add this part earlier but here goes anyway.. In addition to everything else happening inside your body due to prolonged periods without any food intake, another problem arises with regards to bone density loss caused by severe calcium deficiency leading up towards osteoporosis later in life. And finally edit number five! Lastly remember that even though these things happen slowly over time while being exposed constantly through various means including media outlets reporting every single detail available about anything related somehow back around Christmas last year news broke out about people dying after eating nothing but potatoes cooked however way possible followed shortly afterwards by similar stories coming out regarding those same individuals having lost weight quickly once again thanks mostly due their diet consisting solely of said vegetable source alone until either side effects began appearing first OR somebody decided maybe now wasn't really good idea anymore regardless whichever came first one thing became clear very early on though : Not everyone reacts positively towards starving themselves intentionally whether voluntary choice made deliberately knowing full well consequences"
96,"### Human: Who is Alfred George James Hayes?
 ### Assistant: He was an American botanist, born in 1893. His father was a professor of botany and his brother, Arthur Cronquist (), went on to become the most prominent expert on flowering plants after Darwin. A. G. J. Hayes studied at Harvard University from where he obtained his PhD in 1920. The same year he became an assistant curator at Chicago's Field Museum of Natural History. In addition to being an accomplished taxonomic specialist in plant morphology he also worked as an editor for scientific journals such as Science . He died in 1976. Sources: Wikipedia, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , &c. Edit: I should add that during WWII he served with distinction in the US Army Medical Corps. While stationed in Egypt he contracted typhus which eventually led to his death back home. Edit #2: After checking some sources it seems there may be confusion about whether or not he had a younger brother named ""Arthur"" who later changed his name to ""Alfred"". It could have been one person, but either way both brothers were distinguished scientists. Source: . EDIT #3: There are other similar names so make sure you check all your references before posting! Edit #4: Another source lists him under the spelling ""Hayess"", though this appears to only happen once. I don't know if they got their information wrong or if it was just a typo by the author. Edit #5: Just wanted to mention that while editing my original post I realized we already had someone answer your question. Unfortunately I didn't notice until now because I wasn't familiar enough with Reddit etiquette yet when I posted mine. Sorry about that! :) Edit #6: Here is another relevant link -  This page has a pretty good overview of his life and work. Also note how many of the articles linked here discuss his brother, too... Edit #7: An interesting factoid: According to , Arthur C. Cronquist spent time working alongside his older brother in the late 1930s. They collaborated on writing several papers together including ""A new genus and species of Erythroxylaceae."" (1938) and ""The relationship between certain tropical South-American genera of Euphorbiaceae."" (1941). That last paper includes"
97,"### Human: What is the chemical formula and properties of bismuthine?
 ### Assistant: Bismuthine (Bi2S3) has a cubic crystal structure. The most important property of this compound is that it can be used as an amorphous semiconductor, i.e., for electronic applications such as solar cells or LEDs. It's also very easy to synthesize from common materials like bi-metallic alloys. You could even make your own using old pennies!  Here are some interesting links on how you might do so:   This one uses tin instead but seems more straightforward than the first link.  Edit - fixed typo in title. I was thinking about another material called ""bismutite"". Sorry all! :D EDIT AGAIN - Thanks for all the replies everyone! I had no idea there were so many people out there who know their chemistry... I've gotten much better answers here than what I would have been able to come up with myself. Thank you! :) EDIT THIRD TIME - And thanks again everybody! These extra details really help me understand why bismuthine exists. :) EDIT FOURTH AND FIFTH TIME - /u/WarrenJones and /u/Molecular_Bonding both provided great explanations which helped answer my question too! So thank you guys especially, along with everyone else involved in answering these questions. I wish I knew where you all lived so we could get together over coffee sometime. Or tea at least. ;) PS: In case anyone cares, Bi2Se3 is the correct name for . Not sure if OP asked specifically for bismuthine though. Hopefully they will chime back in soon and clarify things. ;P PPS: Since someone mentioned cadmium selenide already, yes indeed CdSe does exist. However, it is not particularly stable because its lattice energy is higher than either CdCl2 or SeO42-. Cadmium sulfides are also known; however, I don't think any of them show good electrical conductivity unless they are made into thin films. For example, CdS is mostly insulating whereas CdTe shows pretty decent conductance when formed into thin layers (like nanowires). Anyway hope those last two paragraphs weren't too confusing. :) edit: grammar edit: formatting edit: added note about cadmium selenide since nobody seemed interested in discussing that possibility anyway lol ^"
98,"### Human: Who was Mary Holt and what were her notable achievements?
 ### Assistant: I'm afraid this is a bit of an odd question. Mary Holt, the daughter of George III, died in 1783 at age 24. She had no children. The Wikipedia page on her is here . She was not married or engaged to anyone during her life; it seems that she never even courted. Her father wrote about his disappointment when he learned that she would never marry (or have children). This does seem strange for someone so young but it appears as though there wasn't much of a scandal surrounding her death - nothing like we might expect from such a story today. So my first thought was ""isn't this too old?"" But then I read some more about her and realized how unusual her situation must have been...she could be our first example of a person who chose celibacy! We do know something else about her: she did write letters which are still extant. They aren't really famous because they don't contain any major revelations about royal family politics etc., just very personal thoughts and opinions. It may sound boring but these letters show us exactly what kind of person she was: shy, quiet, pious. And that last one should probably count as significant since it shows that she didn't want fame/notability either way - being known only by those closest around them seemed perfectly fine with her. Edit: added link to wikipedia article on mary holt edit #2: removed mention of prince regent due to incorrect info found elsewhere online about him being interested in her after her brother died (which i now believe isn't true)   edit #3: fixed formatting issues thanks /u/kayakwolf for pointing out typos :) sorry everyone! if you see anything wrong please let me know & feel free to post suggestions for improvement. Thanks again KayakWolf!!! You rock!!  Edit #5: also wanted to add a source citation for this information- the biography referenced above can be accessed through google books (i think?) although it costs money unless your library has access. It's written by lady riddell and published under title ""The Life Of Queen Victoria"" volume ii chapter xviii section iv paragraph viii pg 609 ff. Hopefully this helps clear things up a little better than before :) Edit #6: edited once again because apparently i am unable to spell correctly despite having done this many times over lol. Also added another"
99,"### Human: What is Kuch Toh Log Kahenge?
 ### Assistant: It means ""What will people say?"" in Hindi. I have seen it used quite a bit as an expression of concern about what others think or how they would judge you based on your actions. A common example might be ""I want to go out and party but my parents won't let me because they are afraid that other kids at school will make fun of me."" Or, more commonly, when someone wants to do something illegal like stealing from their job/school etc., the person fears being found guilty by the public for doing so. The saying comes up frequently whenever there is talk of politics too - politicians don't want voters thinking badly about them if they vote against popular opinion (i.e. If everyone else votes yes then why shouldn't I?) EDIT: spelling Edit2: grammar 101 here! Edit3: Thanks guys :) Edit4: Someone removed all the typos...thanks again :P EDIT5: Ok, thanks everyone who helped correct this post. Now I know better than to just write something without checking it first. This has been edited to reflect feedback from users below. Thank you all very much :) EDIT6: Okay one last time- I was not trying to use sarcasm nor did i mean any offense with these comments. Please take no offence. EDIT7: Finally fixed all those darned mistakes!! Sorry everyone :( EDIT8: Alright folks..I am done now ;) Thank You All So Much For Your Help And Patience!!! Have a great day everybody! Peace Out!! > I can see why some people find India difficult to understand though. Their language seems complex and confusing, yet simple and easy enough to grasp once you learn it. But most importantly, its interesting which makes learning easier. Yes, Indian languages seem complicated due to large number of sounds which are different from English ones(like vowel sounds). But after sometime u get accustomed to it. Also, there are many dialects across various states making things even worse. Even within same state the dialect varies a lot. So, understanding local language becomes crucial sometimes. In addition to above, Indians also tend to speak really fast especially while conversing among themselves. Sometimes I feel like asking them to slow down. Well, thats another story altogether. Lets forget it ;-) Hopefully you understood everything properly. Cheers !
