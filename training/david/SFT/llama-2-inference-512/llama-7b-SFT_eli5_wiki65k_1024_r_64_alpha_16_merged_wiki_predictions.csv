 ### Assistant: The 7.62 × 39 mm (also known as the 7.62 Soviet) is a Russian rifle bullet with a casing for use in semi-automatic guns and assault rifles, such as AKMs or SKSes. It was made to replace the old 7.62x54R during World War II when it became difficult to get ammunition from Germany because they were at war with them. It has been used since then by Russia, China, Vietnam and North Korea. In recent times, the 7.62x39 round has become popular among civilian shooters who enjoy using AR15 style weapons that are chambered in this caliber. This allows people to have more options than just .223 Remington/5.56 NATO rounds while still being able to fire an intermediate size projectile similar to those found in other military arms like M4 Carbines and FAL Rifles. There are also some commercially available models which can accept both types of magazines so you don't need two separate weapons if your needs change over time! These include brands like DPMS Panther Arms Tactical Series Pistols & Carbine Models respectively; Bushmaster BA50 Upper Receiver Assembly For AR-15 Lower Parts Kit w/ Magpul MOE Stock Grip Side Rails Handguard Barrel Length 18"" Black Finish Made Of Steel Aluminum Polymer Plastic USPSA Production Class Match Grade 6 Groove Right Hand Twist Rate 1 : 9""; H&N Smart Shot Super Extreme Reduced Reactive Target Ammo - 50ct Box; H&N Smartshot Super X Extended Range Airgun Pellet .22 Caliber, 12 Gram / Bag of 500; Crosman Copperhead BB Gun Airsoft Metal Frame CO2 Powered 4.5 mm Calibre Semi Automatic Action Single Shot 12 Round Capacity Magazine Spring Loaded Trigger Black; Gamo Whisper Silent Cat Air Rifle With Sound Suppressor And 4X32 Scope 177 Cal - Camo; UTG Pro 1000 Air Soft Combat Training Gun - .177cal/.45"

 ### Assistant: David George ""Dave"" Sims (born 26 October 1950) is an English radio presenter. He was born in London, England and grew up there too. From the late-1970s to early-'80s he presented a Saturday morning show on Radio Caroline. In January 1983 he joined Capital Gold where he became well known for his weekend shows which featured many hit records from the 1940s through to the mid-1980s as well as more recent chart hits. The station later changed its name to Classic Gold but closed down in March 1994. Since then he has been heard mainly on various internet stations. For some years he also presented a Sunday afternoon programme on BBC Radio Oxford. This ended in September 2010 when he decided not renew his contract with them because of their refusal to pay him enough money or give him sufficient airtime. His most regular work nowadays are two programmes every month at 1pm UK time on Friday afternoons called 'The Golden Hour' on www.radiofreelance.com and one hour every Monday evening on www.radioweb.co.uk/classicgoldhits . Both these can be listened live by anyone anywhere around the world who wants to listen online. Other than this he makes occasional appearances on other Internet Stations such as www.radiosure.fm , www.radionord.net and www.talkingretro.com all of whom have shown interest over the past few months in having him do something special each week - sometimes it will just be music that I love playing, often we play music requested by listeners via Facebook etc. Sometimes they ask me to talk about my life story. It's always great fun doing what you want to do rather than being forced into doing things like Top Ten Tuesdays! I don't mind saying here how much I dislike those kind of features so if any Station asks me to do one I won't accept unless they offer big bucks!! As far as recordings go I only make very rare ones these days except for personal use. When I did record broadcasts regularly I would usually send copies off to people who asked for them. Some of those were quite high profile DJs including Mike Read, Tony Blackburn & Chris Evans. There are still plenty out there somewhere though I doubt whether"
2,"### Human: What was the name of the French colony that later became the Republic of Dahomey?
 ### Assistant: The Kingdom of Allada, also known as Oyo or Oidagbon (meaning ""the people's home""), is a former French colony. It was on today's territory of Benin and Togo in West Africa. In 1975 it changed its official name to the Republic of Dahomey. Later it was renamed again by changing its capital city from Abomey to Cotonou. This new country is now called the Republic of Benin. Its current President is Patrice Talon since April 6th, 2016. He replaced Boni Yayi who served for two terms until he left office after being elected president twice but not allowed to run for third term due to constitutional limits. On February 3rd, 2014, Yayi announced his retirement plans at an event where he said goodbye saying “I am going back into my village” before leaving stage with tears streaming down both eyes while waving one hand high above head as crowd cheered loudly all around him giving standing ovation lasting several minutes long time afterwards.” His wife Sylvie Yacé took over presidency until elections were held next year which saw her win election against opponent Mathieu Kérékou making history becoming first woman ever voted leader nationally anywhere worldwide outside United States . She then resigned shortly thereafter citing health reasons thus ending nearly three decades rule under family dynasty founded upon principles democracy equality justice peace security prosperity freedom liberty respect dignity honor integrity honesty transparency accountability responsibility civic engagement civil society participation citizen empowerment human rights social justice environmental sustainability economic development growth innovation progress technology entrepreneurship creativity art culture music dance literature sports education science medicine research technology space exploration etceteraetceteraetceteraetceteraetceteraetceteraetceteraetceteraetceteraetceteraetceteraetceteraetceteraetceteraetceteraetceteraetceteraetceteraetceteraetceteraetceteraetceteraetceteraetceteraetceteraetceteraetceteraetceteraetceteraetceteraetceteraetceteraetceteraetceteraetceteraetceteraetceteraetceteraetceteraetceteraetceteraetceteraetceteraetceteraetceteraetceter"
3,"### Human: What is the name and some characteristics of a moon of Saturn?
 ### Assistant: Aegaeon or S/2004 S 15, formerly known as , is a moon of Saturn. Its discovery was announced by Scott S. Sheppard et al. on October 6, 2004 from observations taken between December 13, 2004 to September 8, 2004; it has been designated . Aegaeon is about 7 kilometres in diameter, and orbits Saturn at an average distance of 22,940,000 km in 1002 days, at an inclination of 155° to the ecliptic (152° to Saturn's equator), with an orbital eccentricity of 0.2609. It belongs to the Norther Reaches group. The mean radius of this satellite is estimated at 7.0 kilometers based upon its surface brightness, which indicates that it consists mainly of water ice. This would make it one of the largest objects found within the outer parts of Saturn's rings. As most of these moons are small bodies orbiting inside the main ring system they may have formed there and then later been captured into their present orbits when the planet acquired its massive ring systems. They might be fragments left over after a collision which destroyed the parent body. This scenario could explain why so many of them appear similar in size. Some scientists believe however, that they were captured from the Kuiper belt before Neptune moved outwards. Most likely this happened during one of its encounters with Jupiter. In any case, all members of this class are thought to share a common origin because of their similar sizes, shapes and colours. Their surfaces show evidence for past geological activity such as cratering and fracturing suggesting active tectonic processes occurred early in each object’s history. Moreover, none display signs indicating recent volcanic eruptions or other evidence pointing towards internal heating caused by radioactive decay like what we see happening today around Io and Europa due to tidal forces exerted by Jupiter. Instead, models suggest that thermal energy generated through gravitational interactions alone should suffice until long after Saturn itself becomes uninhabitable billions of years hence. All except sixteen of these moons lie outside Saturn's F-ring. These last few objects must therefore either have escaped capture earlier on somehow"
4,"### Human: What is the Rambla de las Ovejas and where is it located?
 ### Assistant: The Rambla de las Ovejas (Olive Groves Promenade) is a promenade in Madrid, Spain. It starts at Plaza del Doctor Arce, near Puerta de Alcalá and ends up at Retiro Park. This walkway was created to connect two important places of Madrid's history: the old palace of the Count-Duke of Olivares with its gardens and the former Royal Palace of Aranjuez. These are nowadays both parks. There were once olive trees planted along this road, hence the name ""Ramble of the Olives"". Today there aren't any olives anymore but some ornamental species have been introduced instead. In 1967 the area around the ramble became part of the Parque del Buen Retiro. Nowadays it serves as a leisure zone for tourists visiting these areas. On one side we can find the Paseo del Prado which leads us towards the entrance gate of El Retiro park. On the other hand we may take Avenida de Menéndez Pelayo that goes down from the Casa de Campo until reaching Puente de Segovia bridge over Manzanares River. From here you will be able to see many beautiful sights such as San Jerónimo el Real church or Palacio de los Condes de Griñon house built by order of Philip II in honor of his wife Elisabeth of France who died while giving birth their son Felipe III. You should also know about Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía museum situated on the same spot since 2005 when it moved out from an older building nearby because of renovations works done during past years due mainly by Juan José Lahuerta architectural firm based in Barcelona city within Catalonia region itself too close away not far off distance wise speaking metaphorically talking figuratively implying imaginative idea visualized creativity expressed artistically through artwork sculptures paintings drawings photographs designs architecture etc...all sorts mixed together making sense meaningful thought provoking intriguing interesting fun enjoyable entertainment amusing laughter joy pleasure delight happiness excitement thrill adventure discovery exploration voyage journey quest travel vacation trip expedition excursion escape getaway retreat respite relaxation rest recovery recuperate regenerate revitalize rejuvenate renew refuel refresh restore replenish recharge reinvigorate inv"
5,"### Human: What is an anvil used for?
 ### Assistant: An anvil (or anvils) is a piece of metal equipment that blacksmiths use. It can be made out of steel or iron, and it has been in the past to make other tools such as hammers, chisels and axes. The word ""anvil"" comes from Latin, where it means hammered thing"". There are many different types of anvils, depending on what they're used for. For example, there's one type called a hand-hammering tool which isn't very big but works well because you don't have much weight behind your swing so all energy goes into making smaller things like nails instead of bigger ones like swords; another kind would be larger with more mass underneath its surface area - this allows smoother hits without creating too much force at once since everything gets distributed evenly across multiple points rather than just hitting directly downwards through thick material like wood planks do when struck by something heavy enough not only shatter them completely but also bend back up again if done right! Finally some anvils come equipped with extra features built inside their designs like peg holes drilled straight through both sides allowing easy attachment onto nearby surfaces using simple screws/nuts&bolts etcetera... These allow users accessibility while working away indoors safely thanks largely due these new additions!  In addition, most modern anvils include storage compartments beneath themselves designed specifically around holding various small items found useful during workshop sessions including wrenches &pliers along side spare bits &pieces needed every now then should anything break unexpectedly mid process.. As far back ago Roman times people were already aware how important having proper tools available was especially when dealing large scale projects requiring lots labour hours dedicated solely towards completion alone.... So why wait any longer start shopping today before stock runs low!! You never know might find exactly right size fits perfectly between palms ready go! Just remember though always keep safety first mind when handling potentially dangerous objects like those mentioned above!! Be safe enjoy life!!!
Anvils may be flat, concave, convex or domed. They usually weigh anywhere from about 20 pounds to over 150 pounds. A typical blacksmith will own two or three sizes of anvils ranging from 6 inches wide x 8 inches long to 4 feet tall x 3 ft deep. Some anvils feature decorative patterns cut into their faces with special"

7,"### Human: Who is Emina Jahović Sandal?
 ### Assistant: Emina Jahović Sandal (born 1943) is a Bosnian writer. She was born in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina. In the early 1970s she started to write poems for children's magazines. Her first book of poetry, Izlet u zemlju snova (""Visit To The Land Of Dream"") came out in 1985. She also wrote books about famous writers such as Ivan Goran Kovačić and Vinko Jukić. She has won several awards including the ""Prešeren Award"" from Slovenia. She lives today with her husband, poet Dževdet Škaljo, in Zagreb, Croatia. They have two sons together. One son, Ivica, died at age ten when he fell into an abandoned well near their home. This event inspired many of her later works, especially her novel Oko na koje nije ni svjetla (""Eye On Which There Is No Light""). Many critics consider this work one of the best novels written by any author during or after World War II. It tells how a young boy loses his father due to war-related causes and then tries to find himself through writing stories which are based on true events that happened to him personally. He finally finds peace within himself again thanks largely because his mother had taught him everything important before they were separated forever - namely love, honor & respect for others; kindness towards animals etcetera... Also present throughout all these tales though never explicitly stated so far but rather implied instead would be what could only be described as mysticism perhaps even magic realism if you will considering some aspects like dreams visions hallucinations etc..... All told however there really isn't much more than just pure fiction here nothing else beyond mere imagination itself thus making up most likely half of each story alone while leaving plenty room left over still afterwards too boot! So basically speaking those who enjoy reading fantasy type stuff should definitely give them both books mentioned above try since chances good either might prove quite entertaining indeed :) PS.: If anyone knows where exactly did happen between year(s) 2006–present day please let me know ASAP cause honestly don’t remember myself anymore sadly :( Thanks ahead time folks ;) PPS.: Sorry forgot mention earlier post got deleted somehow due technical glitch probably not sure why actually yet anyway hope someone can help"

 ### Assistant: King Kong (King Kahuna) is a fictional monster. He first appeared as the main antagonist of the 1932 movie, which was remade twice more. The character has since been used for many comic books, television series, cartoons and video games. In each version he plays an important part in popular culture. King Kong's most famous appearance on film came from RKO Pictures when they made King Kong vs Godzilla. This movie is one of the highest grossing films ever produced by any studio or company. It earned over $70 million at the box office alone during its run time. Since then there have been several sequels to this classic story including the original King Kong himself being brought back into action with new stories set after his death but before his birthday party celebrations began! These include Monsters Inc., Eight Legged Freaks and The Lord Of The Rings trilogy where he makes another brief return alongside Peter Jackson who directed all three parts along side Sam Raimi & Guillermo del Torro respectively while also starring James Franco & Billy Connolly amongst others throughout their respective runs across those two decades plus now we wait patiently once again until next year hopefully see yet another adventure featuring our favourite giant gorilla-man albeit slightly shorter than usual due mainly down too budgetary restrictions imposed upon them both here within North America itself thus making him appear taller although still just about managing somehow despite these limitations though maybe not quite so much anymore either sadly speaking anyway...so yeah basically yeah well whatever right??!!???!!!

11,"### Human: What is the format of MPEG-1 and/or MPEG-2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)?
 ### Assistant: MPEG-1 or MPEG-2 Audio Layer 3, also known as MP3, is a digital audio encoding method. It uses lossy compression to reduce data size by eliminating some sounds that are hard for humans to hear. The resulting file can be played on many devices such as computers, portable media players, CDs, DVDs, video game consoles, car stereos and mobile phones. It was developed in the early 1990's by Karlheinz Brandenburg at Fraunhofer Institute for Integrated Circuits IIS with input from Christian Timmerer. In July 1995, it became an ISO standard under name ""MPEG 1.4 Part 3"". There have been several revisions since then. As of November 2007, there were over one hundred million Internet users who listen to music through MP3 files. This number has grown even larger during the years following this date. Over time, more and better sound quality versions of mp3 came out but they did not gain much popularity because of their lack of support by major record companies. Most people still use low bitrate mp3 due to its smaller sizes which makes downloading faster and easier. High fidelity formats like FLAC and Wav do offer higher sound quality than most people would notice but take up a lot more space per song so few people download them instead choosing lower quality options if given no other choice. On average though, around half of all downloaded songs will be stored using either AAC or Ogg Vorbis while only about ten percent will store them as MP3 files despite how widespread these technologies may seem today compared against older methods used before them such as RealAudio/.aiff/.wma etc... Even nowadays when new formats come out every couple months trying harder than ever before at replacing current ones, none really succeed yet leaving us stuck between what seems like two worlds where we must choose between quality versus convenience depending upon our needs at any moment in time until something else comes along someday soon enough perhaps? We shall see! Source code available here : https://github.com/kodein/mp3_parser
The source code is written in C++ language and uses SFML library.
It parses .mp3 files into structs representing each frame (packet) within those files.
Then it converts those frames back into raw PCM data ready for playback on"

13,"### Human: What is the Walt Disney Concert Hall?
 ### Assistant: The Walt Disney Concert Hall (WDCH) in Downtown Los Angeles, California opened on October 24, 2003. It was designed by Frank Gehry and built by Center Operations Company of Los Angeles for $156 million dollars. It is owned by the City of Los Angeles Department of Cultural Affairs and operated by LA Philharmonic Association, Inc., a nonprofit organization. Its acoustics were praised as among the best concert halls in the world when it first opened; however, some people have criticized them since then. The hall has an unusual shape that looks like the shells of sea creatures such as mollusks or crustaceans. Many people think this makes the building look ugly but others find its appearance attractive. Some people say they do not care about how buildings look so long as they are functional. However, most architectural critics agree that the design of the WDCH will be remembered forever because it changed what modern architecture can accomplish. This means future architects may use many ideas from his designs to create new kinds of structures. Criticism also includes concerns over accessibility issues due to narrow stairs leading up into certain parts of the venue which does not meet Americans with Disabilities Act requirements set forth by law at time construction began back during early 2000's era before ADA regulations became enforced nationwide beginning around mid-late 90's decade period until present day year 2018 now currently being enacted upon all across USA territory areas including major cities & towns within each state region regions everywhere throughout entire country nation wide America landmass area continent continental mass surface earth globe planetary orbital orbiting sphere spherical celestial cosmic space universe galaxy galaxia stellar star solar sun heavenly heavens beyond outer reaches infinite vast endless boundless expanse unlimited far reaching distant out there yonder way beyond where no man has gone before exploration voyage journey excursion expedition trek trip travel adventure discovery mission quest pursuit chase follow trail path trodden footsteps walk steps passages ways routes roads highways freeways streets sidewalks paths trails tracks pathways journeys trips expeditions quests missions voyages discoveries visits tours vacation holiday break getaway escape relax rest recuperate recharge revive renew restore refuel recoup recover heal cure wellness"

 ### Assistant: Katrin Tobin (born 1974) is a German author. She was born in Stuttgart, Germany and studied at the University of Konstanz. Her first novel ""Die Wunde"" (""The wound"") won the Deutscher Jugendliteraturpreis in 2006. In 2008 she published her second book called ""Kanak-Babys"". It has been translated into French, Italian, English and Czech. She also writes for newspapers such as Die Zeit or Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. Since April 2013, she lives with her husband and two children on an old farm near Frankfurt am Main. There they run a small goat cheese factory. She wrote about this life change in her third novel ""Der Esel und der Schafhirte"", which appeared in October 2015. The same year it became one of four finalists for the Grimm Prize. On November 28th 2015 she received the prize from the hands of the President Joachim Gauck during a ceremony at Schloss Bellevue. Tobins fourth novel ""Das Glück ist ein Fisch im Wasser"" came out in May 2017 and was awarded by the Deutsche Akademie für Kinder- u Jugendliteratur eV with its highest honor, the Goldene Lyrische Spur. This time Tobin tells the story of a family living in Berlin's Wedding district where her parents grew up. A very popular place among young people today but quite different back then when it still had many refugee camps. In 2019 she received the Hans Christian Andersen Medal. In the same year, her fifth book ""Sieben Tage"" came out. It deals with the current situation around climate change. One day after publication, it reached number three in Amazon’s bestseller list. In December 2019 she will publish another non fiction work entitled ""Gut zu Fuß"" together with her mother Christel Tobin who lives in Australia nowadays. They write about their long walks through Europe. The book will be released in German language only so far. As well as being a writer, Katrin Tobin works as a journalist and teaches creative writing courses. Since September 2020 she runs a YouTube channel under the name “Tobins Traum” to talk about books and other topics related to literature"
15,"### Human: What is the name of the church in the Vasastaden district in Stockholm?
 ### Assistant: The Church of Sweden, Högalid (; ) is a church building at Högalidsgatan 13 on Södermalm. It belongs to the Vasastaden parish of the Diocese of Stockholm and was inaugurated in 1905. History
The first plans for a new church were made as early as 1872 but it took another thirty years before construction could begin. In 1904, an architectural competition was held which resulted in winning designs by Lars Kellgren, Gustaf Lindblom and Helge Zimdahl being chosen out of 60 entries. Construction began later that year with work completed in May 1905. On June 4th, Bishop Johan Albrechtson dedicated the church during its inauguration service attended by King Oscar II along with his wife Queen Sophia. A choir school was established there in 1907 under organist Victor Johansson. Its initial capacity was around three hundred seats. However, this has been reduced over time due to changes in seating arrangements. Today's pews are from 1929 when they replaced original ones designed by Gunnar Asplund who also helped design the altarpiece in the same period. These now serve as benches outside while their former location serves as storage space within. An additional bell tower was added above one side entrance sometime between 1923-27 according to records kept today although no exact date can be given presently since these documents have not yet been translated into English translation services will hopefully be provided soon! This addition allowed more bells than ever before so all five existing peals would ring together at once whenever needed without having any interference whatsoever thanks mainly because each set had its own individual mechanism installed inside them separately rather than sharing just one single system like many other churches do instead . With regards towards size then we find ourselves looking straight down upon our subject matter here below where things get quite interesting indeed ! Take note how wide open those windows appear compared against others nearby ; surely something worth mentioning especially if you happen to look closely enough ? And lastly don’t forget about height either…you know what I mean right ?? Well anyway , lets move onto next part shall we ?? See ya real soon !!

16,"### Human: What is the genre of music that Behemoth plays?
 ### Assistant: Black metal (or blackened death metal) is a type of heavy metal. It started in Norway and Sweden during the early 1980s. Many bands play it, including Mayhem, Emperor, Darkthrone, Immortal, Enslaved, Burzum, Satyricon, Carach Angren, Dimmu Borgir, Cradle Of Filth, Watain, and Behemoth. The name comes from the fact that many people who listen to this kind of music have dark views on life. People also think they are evil because of their stage performances where the members wear corpse paint or hooded robes with horns attached to them. This is not true though; most musicians do not believe what they say about themselves when asked if they consider themselves Satanists. Some musicians claim to be ""anti-religious"" instead. Other musicians just like making scary sounds while playing guitar riffs at high volumes. Mostly all of these genres use similar instruments such as guitars (usually distorted), basses, drums, pianos/synthesizers, etc., but there may be some differences depending upon which country's culture influenced each group more than others'. For example American groups tend towards heavier sounding songs whereas European ones go for lighter tones. There was even an Italian band called Liturgy who made a whole album dedicated solely to chanting chants from Catholic mass services! So you can see how diverse things get once everyone starts experimenting around within certain boundaries set by whatever style(s). If you want something really unique try listening out for those guys known only under pseudonyms...they might surprise ya!! As always remember - keep your head up & stay safe!!!

17,"### Human: Who is Marvin Ronald Lewis and what is his role in the National Football League?
 ### Assistant: Marvin Ronald ""Mr. Marv"" Lewis (born June 25, 1958) is an American football coach who currently works for the Cincinnati Bengals of the NFL as their head coach since January 30, 2004. He was hired by the team to replace Bruce Coslet on that date after a disappointing season in which they went 6–10. In February 2017 it was announced he will not return to coach next year. The announcement came shortly before Super Bowl LI where the New England Patriots beat the Atlanta Falcons 34-28 in overtime. It marked the first time ever there has been no repeat champion from the previous year's game. After this news was made public, many people have said Lewis should be fired because of how poorly the team played during the past few years. However, others say that firing him would cause more problems than keeping him. Some fans even suggested that the team should keep Lewis but fire owner Mike Brown instead. As of now though, nothing can change until the new owners take control of the franchise at some point later this offseason or early into the following one. This means that if any changes are going to happen with either player personnel decisions such as free agency signings/trades etc., then those things won't occur until March 1st when free agents become available again through trades once teams start making them official transactions starting around midnight EST so long ago! On December 4th 2018 Lewis became only third person in history behind Don Shula & Tom Landry win 200 games coaching same team twice . He did this against Pittsburgh Steelers while wearing jersey number #12 . His record stands today at 203 wins , 138 losses , 5 ties and playoff appearances include two AFC championship games winning both times .His most recent victory coming last Sunday night versus Cleveland Browns . During Monday Night Football broadcasts host Chris Berman referred to him affectionately as Mr. Marv.
Lewis was born on May 18, 1958 in Greenwood, Mississippi. At age five moved back home due illnesses caused severe depression among family members including mother Bettye Lewis whom passed away October 2nd 2018 aged eighty four years old . Father Robert worked"

19,"### Human: Who was Hōjō Masako married to and what were her children's names?
 ### Assistant: , also known as or , was a Japanese noblewoman. She is remembered for being the wife of Ashikaga Takauji, who became shogun in 1305. Her parents are not recorded; she had three brothers. In 1286 (Kanenon 4), when she was sixteen years old, she was given away by Emperor Go-Uda as a hostage at the Imperial court along with Princess Chūken and other ladies. This was done because the Kamakura Shoguns did not like that Emperor Fushimi had been placed on the throne without their approval. The next year, the emperor died from illness while he was still under house arrest. After this, both princesses were allowed back into the palace. It appears they stayed there until about 1297 (Genchū 2). At some point after this, Masako went to live in the residence of Ashikaga Tadayoshi. By then, Prince Morinaga had become regent of Japan during his mother's reign. He later abdicated in favor of Emperor Hanazono. During the same period, Masako met Takauji. They fell in love and got engaged. Their marriage took place around 1298 (Shōgen 1) and their first son Kunihito was born in 1299 (Shōhei 1). A second son named Yoritomo followed two years later. Soon afterward, Takauji began taking power over the country which culminated in him becoming shogun in 1305. As part of this process, Takauji moved to Kyoto where he set up his new capital near Gion Shijo Station. Masako lived with him here but eventually returned to Kamakura leaving behind her sons and husband. She never saw them again. Thereafter, Masako led an unremarkable life. When she turned fifty in 1326, she received a pension from the government. Later, she donated money to build temples and shrines including one dedicated to her father-in-law. She retired to the temple called Kifune Shrine in 1330 (Tengyaku 1). She died there at age sixty four. She left behind no written work except letters to friends. One letter has survived today. In it, she describes herself"
20,"### Human: What is a domain name and what are some common domain name extensions?
 ### Assistant: A Domain Name (or Domain) is the part of an internet address that comes after ""www."". For example, if you go to , then your browser will show the website for Google in its window. The most commonly used top-level domains are .com,.org.,net or .edu. Other top level domains include country codes such as those ending with .uk(United Kingdom), .de(Germany), etc.. There are many other TLDs available but they have not been widely adopted by users yet. Some examples would be .biz, .info, .pro, .aero, .travel. These were added recently due to the need for more specificity on websites related to businesses, information sites, professional services providers like doctors/lawyers/accountants who can use them without worrying about confusion with others using similar words at different levels below their own site's URL structure. It also makes it easier when trying out new ideas because there aren’t any long names already taken up somewhere else online so all possibilities become open instead being limited based upon existing registrations which may still exist even though no longer active anymore since registration fees expire over time anyway unless renewed beforehand first! 
The second-level domains are usually associated with companies, organizations and individuals. They often end with one letter followed by numbers from 1–99. An example might look something like this: examplecompanyinc.com where 'examplecompany' could refer either directly back into itself again or indirectly through another subdomain e.g.: support.examplecompanyinc.com. This allows multiple levels within each company's overall namespace making things easy both administratively speaking internally but also externally too allowing customers access whatever area suits best depending how much detail needs explaining versus just getting straight down onto doing actual work themselves perhaps via email correspondence rather than having direct interaction face2face etc... In addition these types of addresses tend towards shorter ones meaning less typing required while saving valuable real estate space needed elsewhere too!! Another benefit worth mentioning here regarding these kinds offormalities wouldbe security issues surrounding malicious code execution attacks known collectively under termphishing scams whereby hackers trick victims into giving away sensitive info simply because they think someone trustworthy requested same requesting further action upon receipt; however unlike previous method mentioned above requires user input response confirmation prior proceeding ahead thus providing extra protection measure against potential harmful consequences occurring otherwise had no"
21,"### Human: What is a shotgun and how does it work?
 ### Assistant: A Shotgun, or ""Pump-Action"" Gun, is a firearm that fires small objects called shots. It has an open tube with two parts to the barrels (one for each round). The gun uses gas from firing one of its rounds to power the next round's movement through both tubes at once.  This causes many pellets in front of you when shooting long range targets such as birds or rabbits because there are so few bullets being fired compared to other guns like rifles which use more powerful ammunition but have less accuracy over longer distances than pistols do since they don't need any kind of sighting device attached on top before pulling back their trigger while holding onto something stable behind them while aiming downwards towards whatever target was chosen prior taking aim first though this isn’t always necessary depending upon circumstance.”. This means if someone shoots another person then everyone will be able see where he went wrong during his last attempt at hitting anything nearby by looking closely enough after some time passes between tries!

 ### Assistant: Franco Marini (27 March 1930 – 8 April 2020) was an Italian politician. He served as President of the Senate from 2006 to 2008 and again in 2015, both times under Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. In May 2014 he joined The People of Freedom party led by his former boss, Berlusconi. From 2008 until his death, he was a member of the Chamber of Deputies for the Democratic Party. His political career began in 1968 when he became mayor of Salerno. He retired on 1 October 2015. He died at his home in Rome on 8 April 2020 after suffering a stroke, aged 90. Tributes were paid by fellow politicians including Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte and deputy prime minister Luigi Di Maio. He also received tribute from U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo who called him ""a great friend"" and said that he had been a ""tireless advocate for Italy"". Former Italian president Giorgio Napolitano described him as one of Italy's most important senators ever. On 10 June 2020, Pope Francis sent condolences to his family and friends. A funeral Mass took place on 11 July with only close relatives present due to COVID-19 restrictions. Due to his time serving during World War II, Marini is buried alongside other war veterans in the Monumental Cemetery of Milan. A street in Milan has since been named after him. An asteroid discovered in February 2019 is named in honor of him too. It orbits between Mars and Jupiter. The name ""Marinì"" means small marine creature in Neapolitan dialect which reflects Marini's birthplace of Salerno. The official naming citation reads ""Franco MARINÌ (born in Salerno), former Senator."". This asteroid will pass very near Earth once every 17 years. Its closest approach to our planet occurs this year; it passed about .3 million miles away. That distance is less than halfway to the moon. Marini himself never saw it because he did not live long enough to do so. He turned down the opportunity to be cremated but donated all of his organs except his"

He joined the band Running Wild at age 18 as their lead guitar player. In addition to being an accomplished solo artist he also worked on many studio albums for artists such as Grave Digger, Edguy, Masterplan, Axel Rudi Pell and Brainstorm among others.

It reached #30 on the Billboard Top New Artist Albums chart. A second album followed up three years later entitled Dreamland Manor featuring members of Symphony X, Stryper, Iced Earth and Savatage. This album didn't do nearly as well reaching only #44 on that same list but it did receive some positive reviews from critics who compared him favorably to Eddie Van Halen. During this time period Michael had also begun working closely with Helloween bassist Markus Grosskopf who became instrumental in helping him secure distribution deals outside Europe through EMI Music Japan where they were able to get Japanese editions made available of both releases including bonus tracks not found elsewhere worldwide. These versions have since become highly sought after collectors items amongst fans around globe due primarily because there are no plans currently planned any future re-issues or remasters forthcoming either physically digitally so far anyway although anything could happen down road if enough demand exists though unlikely given current state affairs surrounding COVID-19 pandemic etcetera...

28,"### Human: What is the size range of the Oaxacan cloud forest tree frog?
 ### Assistant: The Oaxacan cloud forest tree frog (Dendropsophus minutus) is a small frog from Mexico. Scientists have seen it as low as 1075 meters above sea level and as high as 2346 meters. It lives in the Sierra Madre del Sur mountain chain, which runs through southern Puebla state to northern Guerrero state. This species looks similar to Dendropsophus microcephalus but its voice box has more vocal folds than that one does. Its feet are webbed. When it calls at night, this frog sounds like ""chirp-wheep"". Males sing during the breeding season when there is plenty of rainwater available. They call for about three minutes then stop calling for ten or fifteen minutes before starting again. These frogs lay eggs on leaves overhanging bodies of water such as streams. There are lots of them because they do not move much after mating. Adult males stay close together while adult females stay farther apart. After the tadpoles hatch into larvae, the parents leave their territory. Male frogs fight with other male frogs if another group moves onto their turf. Frogs that live near ponds can be very aggressive towards each other so scientists think these groups may defend their territories against predators instead of rivals. Tadpole development takes between two weeks and six months depending on how cold the weather gets where the female lays her eggs. Some people keep captives alive longer by raising them inside aquariums filled with leafy plants. Fertilized eggs take seven days to develop into tadpoles. Eggs laid in colder places take less time; those laid in warmer places take more time. Female frogs make nests under rocks or logs in slow moving streams or pools. She puts some leaves around her nest and sits on top of them until she lays her clutch of eggs. A female can lay up to eight hundred eggs in a single day. Each egg is about half an eighth of an inch long. The tadpoles eat algae growing on the surface of the water. Sometimes they also feed on insects living in the water. They grow faster in warm conditions. They turn greenish brown once they become bigger. Their skin turns darker later. In cooler climates, the skin stays white longer. Young"

Barnard was born to a Dutch Reformed family near Beaufort West, Western Cape Province of South Africa. His father died when he was ten years old leaving his mother with five children under her care. The oldest child, Christaat, had already left home before their father's death. In 1945, after completing medical school training in Johannesburg, he moved back into his parental home where he lived until moving out again fourteen months later. At that time he married Aletta Klaasen whom he met during his studies. They divorced in 1950. In 1952 he remarried Marike van der Merwe who gave birth to two daughters but they also separated six years later. During this period he worked as an assistant physician in a hospital in Port Elizabeth. Thereafter he returned to Cape Town working as a general practitioner.

He performed many innovative operations including some of the earliest coronary artery bypass graft procedures using saphenous vein autografts and homologous arterial conduits. In addition he developed techniques for balloon angioplasty in patients suffering from acute myocardial infraction. A year or so prior to the world famous event he set up a research laboratory in his own house. Here he carried out pioneering work in xenotransplants and artificial hearts. He published over one hundred scientific papers mainly focusing on cardio thoracic surgical problems. He remained active until very late in his career. As recently as 1999 he presented results of experiments involving stem cells in treating heart disease. For these activities he received several"
33,"### Human: What is Bulgogi and where does it originate from?
 ### Assistant: Bulgogi (Korean pronunciation: ) or bulgoki, means ""fire meat"" in Korean. It refers to thinly sliced beef served with vegetables and a variety of sauces such as soy sauce, sesame oil, sugar cane syrup, garlic chives, onions, green peppers, mushrooms etc.. The dish has its origins in the Joseon Dynasty around 108 A.D., when people started using fire pits for cooking meats. Since then, different kinds of meat have been added to this delicious cuisine. Today, there are many variations of bulgogi that use various types of meat including seafood like abalone and shrimp; and even kimchi-style flavors which include fermented cabbage mixed into the marinade along with other ingredients depending upon personal preference/culture/region. In South Korea today you will find restaurants specializing solely in making traditional bulgogi dishes while others offer modern interpretations incorporating unique twists on age old recipes by adding spices such as cumin powder or star anise extracts among other things. Some establishments may also serve up regional favorites like galbi (beef short rib) or samgyetang (chicken soup). No matter what type(s)of bulgogi one chooses though they all share similar characteristics - namely being tender pieces of meat paired perfectly with complementary side dishes like steamed rice & banchan (small portions of pickled veggie sides). When eaten together these two items form part if not most important elements needed complete any true Korean feast! This makes sense given how integral both components remain within everyday life throughout Asia today despite vast cultural differences between nations located across thousands miles apart . For example Japan's own version called yakiniku uses grilled lamb instead whereas Chinese versions feature stir fried duck breast accompanied fresh lettuce leaves rolled tight before serving alongside dipping sauce made out soybean paste salt vinegar mixture commonly referred simply 'black bean.' And last but certainly farthest away from home Thai style curry based preparations exist too...the list goes on forever really!! So whether your taste buds crave something sweet savory salty tangy zesty smoky whatever else just remember always keep an open mind because who"

 ### Assistant: The U.S. state of Vermont is in the northeastern United States, bordering Canada to its north and New York State to its south. It has a population of about 630 thousand people (2015). Most of the people live along Lake Champlain or one of the rivers that flow into it from the west. About half of them are concentrated around Burlington, which also contains the largest city, called ""the Queen City"". The other main cities include Rutland and Montpelier. There are more than two hundred towns in Vermont; each town elects local officials who make decisions on how taxes will be spent within their borders. This system was created when Vermonters wanted control over themselves rather than let others decide what would happen with money they paid as part of property taxes. In addition to being home to many small farms growing dairy products such as milk cheese butter etc., there are large industrial operations including paper mills lumber yards furniture manufacturing plants food processing facilities textile factories chemical companies plastics makers electronics assemblers machine shops metal fabricators steel foundries concrete blocks brick tile cement clay pottery glass bottles ceramic tiles porcelain dinnerware china dishes silver jewelry gold coins and much more!

36,"### Human: What is the title and artist of the painting ""Ideal Landscape with a Young Man Killing a Snake""?
 ### Assistant: Ideal Landscape with a Young Man Killing a Snake (also called The Fable of Orpheus) is an oil on canvas by Dutch painter Hercules Seghers. It was painted in 1649, during his time working for Philip IV of Spain at the Buen Retiro Palace in Madrid. This picture has been attributed to Rembrandt since it first appeared in print as such in the 18th century; but most scholars now agree that it is not actually by him. Many art historians believe this work may have been done under Rembrandt's direction or supervision, however. The young man shown in the image is thought to be a self-portrait. The snake appears to represent evil itself. This would make the young man a symbol of goodness triumphing over evil. Some think that the scene depicts the moment when Orpheus kills the serpent sent against him from Hades by the goddess Eurydice after she dies while fleeing its bite. However, others see the young man as representing Christ slaying Satan. Still other interpretations exist, including one which sees him killing the devil himself. Another interpretation is that he is showing the death of Moses in Exodus 32:30–35 where Moses breaks down into anger because of Israelites worshipping idols made out of gold. The young man then tells Moses that God will punish them all equally. A similar story can also be found in Psalm 78:56 where David says “Moses’ anger flared up and he broke the tablets.” In both stories, these are seen as examples of how men can react violently toward people who worship false gods rather than trusting only in Jehovah. Others point to the fact that the man wearing armor looks like someone from another period altogether - perhaps even earlier times before there were any known records about what happened between those two events mentioned above? So maybe instead of being based off either biblical passages or classical mythology tales involving snakes or lions attacking humans etc., something else entirely could explain why some viewers might connect these images together despite having nothing specific linking them together except their appearance alone!

From April, he became leader of the Socialist Party group in Parliament after being replaced by Carlos Martins Branco. Moniz also served as Mayor of Lisbon between June 18th, 1973 - February 1st, 1974 under the Carnation Revolution.

His funeral will be held later this month. It's unknown if there will be any political tributes. The most likely one would be Antonio Costa, who said that ""Ricardo Moniz leaves an indelible mark in our history."" This may lead to another round of elections in Portugal. On November 24th, Pedro Nuno Santos was elected as new president of the assembly. There are currently no plans for him to replace Moniz but he could become interim president while waiting for a successor election or appointment. A special session where Moniz's replacement will take place within weeks or days depending how quickly they want someone else installed rather than wait till next year when parliamentary terms end anyway because people don't like change unless absolutely necessary which isn’t really true here either way so let me just say goodbye now please thank you very much have nice day!

41,"### Human: Who is Joshua Wong Chi-fung and what is his role in the Umbrella Movement and pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong?
 ### Assistant: Joshua Wong Chi-fung (born 13 May 1996) is a student activist from Hong Kong. He was one of the leaders of the Umbrella Movement, which took place between September to December 2014. During this movement he became known as ""Hong Kong's Martin Luther King"". In June 2017, Wong led hundreds of thousands of people into marches against an extradition bill that would allow people to be sent to mainland China for trial. This started mass demonstrations across Hong Kong on 9 June 2019 called by students who were worried about their future after Beijing tightened control over the semi-autonomous city. The government said it will withdraw its plans to amend the law but there are still calls for more changes. On 5 August 2019, Joshua Wong was arrested with fellow Demosisto party members Agnes Chow Tsz-Wah and Ivan Lam Ming-yau while they were holding a rally at Yuen Long metro station. They have been charged under two sections of the Public Order Ordinance - incitement of others to take part in public assembly without permission or authorisation, and taking part in such a gathering themselves. If convicted, each faces up to three years behind bars. Their case has become a test of how far authorities can go in cracking down on dissent since Beijing imposed sweeping national security laws in July last year. It also comes amid rising tensions between Hong Kongers and police following violent attacks by mobsters on civilians during recent anti-government unrest. Many fear these trials could set dangerous precedents if found guilty. As a result, many supporters came out to show support for them outside court every day until November 8th when all four defendants pleaded not guilty. However, Judge Kwok Kar-kwan rejected bail applications made by Mr. Wong & Miss Chow due to concerns about flight risks despite assurances given by both parties’ legal teams; instead granting conditional release orders allowing them home detention pending further proceedings before being remanded back inside prison cells once again awaiting verdicts expected early next month!

43,"### Human: What is the name and discovery date of asteroid 90?
 ### Assistant: (90) Antiope or , was a minor planet discovered by French astronomer Alphonse Louis Nicolas Borrelly on August 28, 1866. It belongs to the group of C-type asteroids with carbonaceous composition in the inner main belt between Mars and Jupiter. The asteroid has been named after one of the Danaides who were killed as punishment for their father's crime. It is also known as . On October 5th, 1873 it was observed by James Craig Watson during his visit to Arequipa Observatory at an altitude of about 2400 meters above sea level. He described its appearance ""like a large star"". During this observation he saw two other faint stars nearby which are now identified as asteroids 108 Isis and 109 Penelope. This makes them the first three asteroids ever seen from Earth. In 1999 the asteroid was visited by NASA spacecraft NEAR Shoemaker. Its surface temperature was measured and found to be about -20°C. Average density of 1.2 g/cm³ shows that there must be some ice present inside the rocky body. Some water vapor may have escaped into outer space but most likely remains trapped within the asteroid. Because of this small amount of frozen liquid, the asteroid could be called a pseudocomet according to IAU definition. Comets always release huge amounts of gas when they get close enough to Sun. If we compare this behavior with the asteroid's orbit around our local star, then it becomes clear that the cometary activity can not happen here because of too low distance from the Sun. Such bodies are sometimes referred to as ""dirty"" comets since their surfaces appear dark due to high content of organic compounds. These substances absorb sunlight very efficiently and heat up the objects much more than regular rocks would do under similar conditions. As a result many dirty comets show signs of recent volcanism while others look like giant rubble piles covered by thick layers of dust. The same applies to the asteroid 90 Antiope whose interior temperatures reach several hundred degrees Celsius near perihelion passage every few years. There should be no such thing happening if only solid material existed inside these bodies without any free liquids or gases released by sublimation process. However, scientists"
44,"### Human: What does particle size refer to?
 ### Assistant: Particle size is the diameter of a small object. It can also be called grain size or particle dimension, and it refers to how big an object is in comparison with others that are around it. The word ""particulate"" means something like this too. If you have some sand on your hands, then all those tiny little pieces of rock are particles. A piece of paper has particles as well (but they're much smaller). In chemistry, we usually mean very fine particles when talking about nano-science. These objects are so small that one millionth of them would fit across a human hair. We call these nanoparticles. Some types of dust, such as talcum powder, may contain lots of different sized particles which are made from the same substance. This makes it hard for us to tell what kind of material each individual particle is actually made out of. For example, if there were 1000 tiny white marbles mixed together into a bag full of other stuff, then I might not know exactly where the white ones ended up until after I sorted through everything carefully. So scientists use special instruments to measure things like mass per unit volume, density, etc., instead of just looking at their appearance under a microscope. Scientific measuring equipment helps determine what kinds of materials make up any given sample without having to sort everything first by hand! You should remember though - most people don't need fancy tools; even your own eyes will do just fine sometimes :) TLDR: Particles are small bits of matter that come apart easily but stick back together again quickly once disturbed. They can be found anywhere because anything solid eventually breaks down into tiny chunks over time due to friction caused by moving parts rubbing against each other constantly throughout our daily lives—and beyond! But don’t worry; if someone says “Particle,” he probably won’t expect you to understand what she means unless she gives more details than usual anyway…so enjoy reading about science while learning new words along the way:) P.S.: Here’s another interesting factoid: Most particles are actually invisible since light doesn’t travel fast enough through air/water/whatever else surrounds them at normal temperatures...unless they happen upon some rare opportunity like being inside bubbles filled with liquid nitrogen gas during summer heat waves ;) Just kidding...mostly....(or am I?)

They are survived by their four children, seven grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. Their eldest daughter, Tara Maki-Huntley, has been living with her mother’s illness diagnosis since last fall.

47,"### Human: What is marzipan and how is it used in sweets and cakes?
 ### Assistant: Marzipan (also known as almond paste) is a sweet made of sugar, egg whites, water and ground almonds. It has been used for centuries to make small figurines called ""pâte à modeler"". In the Middle Ages, it was sometimes eaten instead of meat at fasting times such as Lent or Advent. Today, it can be found inside many kinds of cake, including fruitcake, sponge cake, pound cake, buttercream-filled layer cakes, chiffon cake, angel food cake, Bundt cake, sheet cake, pudding cups and cupcakes. Most recipes call for icings that are either white, red, green, blue, purple or yellow. These colors come from gelatin added into the mixture. The most common coloring ingredient is corn syrup with natural dyes derived from fruits and vegetables. Sometimes other ingredients like coconut oil may also be present in commercial brands. 
Marzipan is often used by bakers to decorate their creations. There are two types of marzipans - soft and hard. Hard marzipan tends to stay longer than soft ones. Soft marzipan should not be stored overnight because it will become sticky when exposed to humidity. If you want your soft marzipan to last long without getting too dry then cover it tightly after each use so no air gets through until next time around again! This way there'll always be enough moisture left behind even if someone else touches them beforehand since they won't absorb any extra liquid while sitting out uncovered all night long waiting patiently till morning comes along once more ready again...and repeat ad infinitum....until finally reaching our final destination point where we reach perfection itself.....""the end"" :) .....or maybe just another beginning?

 ### Assistant: Lake Saiful Muluk () or Shogran Lake (), also called the ""Bridal Veil Falls"", is a lake in the northern areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, Pakistan. It lies at an altitude above sea level and 40 km northwest of Naran. The lake's name comes from a local legend about a saint named Saif-ul-Malook who drowned himself after being rejected by his beloved. There are two waterfalls near this area which are known as 'Saiful Mulok'. This place has been declared a national park. It was opened to tourists on November 15, 2017. At that time there were no facilities for camping but it has now been developed with many hotels and campsites. It can be reached through jeeps up until a point where they cannot go further due to snow cover. After that people have to walk around three kilometres to reach their destination. The best season to visit here is between April and September when weather remains pleasant throughout most parts except during heavy rains. In winter months you will need warm clothes because temperatures drop below freezing points. During summer monsoon season starting mid June till end August light rain showers occur frequently making roads slippery so caution should always be taken while driving along these routes especially if travelling alone without any company/guide etc..

50,"### Human: What is the House of slaves and where is it located?
 ### Assistant: The House of Slaves (Portuguese: Casa dos Escravos) was a house in Angra do Heroísmo, Terceira Island, Azores. It served as an entry point to Portugal for African slaves until 1836 when slavery ended there. In this place people were sold into slavery by Portuguese slave traders from their ships anchored nearby. They would then be transported to sugar plantations on other islands or mainland Portugal via cargo ship. Today the building houses a museum about the history of slavery at that time. The name ""House of Slaves"" was given after independence because the former owners did not want to remind visitors of its past use. Many of them were descendants of those who had been enslaved here. Some still lived in the area. There are also many tourists visiting the island every year. This has led some to believe that they should call it something else so as not to offend anyone's sensibilities. However, most agree with keeping its original title since it reflects how important it was during colonial times. People could go inside but only if accompanied by someone knowledgeable enough to explain what happened there before being allowed back out again afterwards. Tour guides usually give tours around these places while telling stories about what took place within each room along the way. Visitors can look through windows onto balconies overlooking streets below which used to serve as parking lots filled full of cars belonging either locals working elsewhere across town or foreign workers coming home late night shifts following long days spent laboring under harsh conditions abroad somewhere far away like South America Brazil Colombia Peru etcetera... 
The last known person held captive against his will died there in 1920 aged approximately seventy-five years old having never seen any real freedom outside prison walls ever since birth!

 ### Assistant: William John Wills (24 January 1834 – 29 June 1861) is considered to be the first Australian born explorer. He worked with Robert O'Hara Burke and Charles Gray in an attempt at crossing Australia from south-east Queensland, across central Australia to Port Darwin on the north coast of what is now known as Northern Territory. The expedition failed because both Burke and Gray died during the trip back to Coopers Creek where they had left their supplies. This occurred after only reaching a distance of about . It has been estimated that there were more than 50 people who knew that he would die before his death. His body was found by John King in 1873 when searching for any sign of Burke or Gray. In 1864, a monument called ""The Monument"" was built near the spot where Wills died. A statue of him stands next to it. Also nearby are the graves of Burke and Gray. There are many other monuments and memorials dedicated to them throughout Victoria. On 2 October 2004, the Australian Government announced plans to build a new national park named Wills Outback Heritage Park which will include some of the sites important to this historic event. One hundred years later, another man walked around the world, Paul Theroux did so without using motorized transportation. When asked why not use motor vehicles he said, “I wanted to know if I could do it.” He also wrote two books while doing so. They are Riding High and Sunrise With Seamonsters. Both have been made into movies starring Pierce Brosnan and David Suchet respectively. Both men were Englishmen but one lived much longer than the other. For example, Theroux’s father died at age fifty-eight whereas Wills’ mother passed away three months shy of her eightieth birthday. However, since we cannot compare apples to oranges then maybe it makes sense comparing peaches instead; however even though peach trees grow upwards rather than down like apple trees they still produce fruits just like every other fruit tree does except for those ones whose seeds need special conditions such as warm temperatures or high humidity levels etc….. Anyway you look at things there seems no way out unless perhaps someone invented something similar enough to make comparisons possible!

55,"### Human: What is the history and origin of Denial Bay?
 ### Assistant: Denial Bay was a bay in Antarctica. It used to be part of the ocean, but it has been frozen up for millions of years because glaciers have come down from the ice cap on top of it. This means that water cannot flow into or out of the area anymore. The name came about as early explorers went through this region they were amazed by how much snow there was compared to other areas at similar latitudes such as McMurdo Sound. They thought no one could possibly live here due its harsh conditions so they called their discovery ""Denial"". Since then many expeditions have gone further south than ever before including those led by Sir Ernest Shackleton who reached 87 degrees South which would later become known as Cape Evans where he established his base camp during an attempt on reaching pole itself (but failed). In honor of these efforts today's version includes parts named after some key members like Mount Nansen & Mount Scott both found near Cape Evans while also honoring another famous polar explorer Fridtjof Nansen whose ship Fram spent months trapped in thick pack-ice around this same spot back when Norway first began sending men southward seeking glory amongst giants like Amundsen himself! But now we know better thanks largely too scientists studying changes happening beneath our feet right now...and even though most people still think nothing lives within miles upon miles worthless white stuff covering every square meter available; well actually quite few species thrive here including penguins whales seals birds fish etcetera making sure life goes on regardless whatever mankind decides do with planet earth next year/decade..etc....so don't worry just keep doing what needs done until someone else comes along takes care things themselves :) PS If anyone knows any more info please feel free contact me via email address listed below thank you very much!!!!!

56,"### Human: What are cannabinoids and how do they work?
 ### Assistant: Cannabinoid is a chemical compound found in the cannabis plant. They have an effect on the brain, which gives users of marijuana their high feeling. There are two main types of cannabinoids that act upon cells (called receptors) in our body. These are called endocannibanoids and phytocannibanoids respectively. The first type acts as neurotransmitters within the central nervous system. Phyto means ""plant"" in Greek. This group includes THC (tetrahydrocannabinol), which has psychoactive effects; CBD (cannabidiol); and CBN (cannabinol). In addition to these three well-known ones there are over 100 other known molecules from plants or animals with similar actions but not yet identified by scientists so far! Endo refers here specifically towards those produced naturally inside us rather than outside sources like food/drugs etc... When we smoke cigarettes containing nicotine then it's because this substance binds itself onto specific sites located near nerve fibres throughout your whole body causing them all at once feel relaxed while stimulating certain hormones released into circulation through blood vessels leading ultimately up until finally reaching target areas where dopamine levels rise significantly resulting ultimately again back down again after some time passes making sense now why people get addicted easily due its rewarding properties :) . However if you were smoking marijuana instead perhaps another way would be possible without getting hooked since no such thing exists currently except maybe synthetic versions created artificially under controlled conditions somewhere else around world probably Japan lol just kidding don’t worry everyone knows what I mean haha jkjkjkkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjkjk"

It was released on November 5, 2007 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 systems. The PC version came out in January 18th, 2008. A Wii port called Call of Duty: Reflex Edition was released later on April 9, 2009. This version did not have all of the features that the original versions had but it still sold well. Another version was created specifically to be played on the Nintendo DS system which included voice acting and WiFi support. All versions received positive reviews from critics except for the Wii's reflex edition. Activision announced they would release another installment named Call of duty black ops 2 with an action movie style trailer showing off many new weapons like the AKM and RPG. They also said there will be two other games coming soon after this one. One being call of duty modern warfare 3(MW3). The second one being Black Ops II. Both are currently available at most stores around the world. There has been rumors about a fourth Modern Warfare sequel based off of the campaign mode and multiplayer modes of both previous games. Also, EA plans to make Battlefield 4 with realistic graphics so gamers can play through various missions just like how people do in Call Of Duty. EA wants their battle field series to become more popular than cod because battlefield always gets better ratings compared to cod every time a new title comes out. However, we don’t know if these rumored games exist yet since nothing official has come up stating that any of them were true or false. Only time will tell us whether or not those stories turn into actual products down the road! So far though I believe there might possibly be some truth behind what others say…we shall see!! As long as developers continue making good titles then fans should enjoy playing whatever genre interests them most!!! :) PS - Sorry for any typos/grammar errors here guys...my brain isn't working too great today lol:) edit: i forgot to mention that MW2 got bad reviews due to its terrible online matchmaking system which resulted in people having trouble finding matches even when trying hard enough while also experiencing lag"
58,"### Human: What is Burgundy?
 ### Assistant: Burgundy (; ) is a historical region in east-central France. It was the heartland of the Franks from 534 and later became the core of what today are called France, Belgium, Luxembourg and Switzerland. The capital city of Burgundy has been Dijon since the Middle Ages. Its inhabitants were known as Burgundians or Frankons at first. From about AD 600 onwards they came to be called by their Germanic language name which gave its name to this area - ""Burgondes"". The modern French word for them is Bourguignons. In English it is often spelled with an o instead of ue because that was how the letter U sounded when written during medieval times. This led to words such as ""burgess"" being used before the pronunciation changed again around 1200. Today's version would have come much earlier if not for printing presses making it easier than ever before so people could read without knowing Latin anymore either! The Romans named this land after the Gallic tribe living there who spoke Proto-Germanic languages like all other tribes across Europe at that time period too though some did speak Celtic ones including Irish Gaelic still spoken today even though most don’t know anything else besides Spanish/Portuguese nowadays due mostly because those two countries took over Ireland centuries ago while England ruled Scotland until recently but only recently stopped doing so thanks largely due political reasons rather than military ones unlike back then where armies fought battles every day trying hard kill each other off completely till no one remained alive left standing anywhere within miles radius around any given place except maybe just far enough away never get caught up close enough fighting nearby anyway.” So yeah basically everything bad happened here cause everyone wanted fight wars against anyone else possible always unless agreed otherwise peacefully negotiated treaties signed between opposing sides agree upon terms mutually beneficial both parties satisfied outcome achieved successfully finally resulting happily ending story happier lives lived long lasting forevermore...or something along those lines :) PS I hate writing these kinds posts sometimes lol..so sorry if boring reading through my rambling nonsense drivel blahblahblahhahaha :))))) xoxo <3 ;) & #$%@#$^&*()_+=[]{}<>?,./ \-“”‘’’\’’\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"

The phone's operating system is Symbian OS v9.3 S60 3rd Edition Feature Pack 1 (FP1). This version also supports Java ME MIDP 2.0 applications which are available from the Ovi Store. Its successor is the Nokia 7610. On June 26, 2019, it was announced that Nokia will be releasing an Android-powered device called ""Nokia 7650"" for $30 USD as part of their retro collection. However, this announcement turned out to be false after fans found no mention or information about such product online. As of May 2021, there have not been any rumors about the Nokia 7650 returning to production. In July 2021, a user reported seeing a prototype Nokia 7650 running Android at Nokia Mobile’s headquarters in Finland. He claimed that he saw the device while visiting HMD Global's R&D facility located inside the company's main building. According to him, the handset featured a Qualcomm chipset underneath its glass back panel. It would appear that development had ceased once more, however, when he visited again three months later - nothing seemed to have changed. No official confirmations were given either way regarding whether or not this project ever got off ground so far we can only assume what happened behind closed doors between then until now...

 ### Assistant: Albania was first at the Olympic Games in 1964. The International Olympic Committee's official abbreviation for Albania is ALB. History
The National Olympic Committee for Albania (NOC) was formed and recognized by the IOC on May 30, 1957. It missed two games because of political reasons; In 1980 it boycotted the Moscow Summer Olympics to support a US-led boycott against the Soviet Union. Also they did not compete in Los Angeles because Yugoslavia refused to let them go through their country which would have been needed to get there. Since then, they have competed in every summer game since except one when they were banned from competing due to government interference with sports. They also sent athletes to the Winter Olympics starting in 2002. Their best performance came during the 2004 Athens Summer Olympics where they won three medals including a gold medal for Greta Gevorgyan in Judo. As of now, no athlete has ever represented Albania at both winter and summer games although several have come close such as Edmond Kokshi who participated in the luge event at Nagano but failed to qualify for the main competition while his brother Fatmir finished second behind Aleksandr Tretyakov of Russia during preliminary heats before being eliminated himself. Another example is Enis Osmanaj whose skating skills earned him an invitation onto Team Canada’s short track speedskating squad prior to Pyeongchang 2018 however he ultimately declined this offer citing personal reasons . Overall though only seven athletes have managed accomplish this feat thus far out of hundreds that have tried over multiple decades worth of time spanning nearly half century long period between mid seventies till present day most recent instance happened back last month when Erjon Tola became latest addition into select group after winning bronze medal during World Championships held earlier same year just weeks ago. He will be joining ranks alongside fellow compatriots Violeta Hysenbegovića & Agim Gjinali who already achieved similar distinction few years ago respectively . Other notable names include Neritan Aderi , Elona Bregolli , Dorina Cakulezhi , Sotiris Dimitrakopoulos & Lulzim Peci , all former world champions or multiple times medalists throughout career paths"

In 2008, the movie was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress because ""it is 'culturally, historically or aesthetically significant.'"" The movie had been banned in Britain until 1975 when it received its UK cinema release. The movie got mixed reviews on initial release but later became highly regarded by critics over time. Roger Ebert gave it four out of four stars. He called it one of the greatest movies ever made about homosexuality. Time Out magazine listed The Servant as #47 on their list of all-time best films. The Guardian ranked it #54 on their list of the top 1000 movies. Empire magazine rated it #21 on their Top 500 Greatest Movies Of All Time poll.

 ### Assistant: The National Museum of Brazil, (Portuguese: Museu Nacional de Brasil), was a national museum in Rio de Janeiro. It has been open since December 7th 1954. Its collections include about five million objects from pre-historic times until today. In September 2018 it caught fire while being renovated. This destroyed many items inside. Some people blame president Jair Bolsonaro who cut funding to public institutions during his first year as President. He did this because he thinks that money should be spent on police forces instead. However, some experts say that the cause of the fire might have also been arson by thieves or vandals trying to steal valuable artifacts. The damage caused by the fire made the loss of cultural heritage even greater than the devastating Gulf War looting of Iraq's National Museum. More than one hundred thousand pieces were lost including priceless Egyptian artefacts like a sarcophagus dating back more than two millennia. A few days later, a similar incident happened at the National Library. At least half of all books stored there burned down too. As a result, around 3% of the country’s entire collection of historical documents disappeared forever. The government declared three days of mourning after these events. Nowadays, rebuilding efforts are underway. But it will take years before the institution can recover completely. Many scholars fear that the recovery process may not succeed due to lack of funds. They argue that only with sufficient investments can we hope to preserve our collective memory. That way future generations won’t lose access to important information regarding human history. And they believe that every person living today shares responsibility towards ensuring such preservation takes place successfully.

A grandson of his first marriage lives in New York City where he runs a restaurant. He had one brother Jacques Raynaud who worked as an accountant in Brussels. Both brothers were members of the social democratic party PS. His father died in 1982. His mother died after being hit by a car while crossing a road in Paris in October 2016 aged 97 years old. She lived alone in a small house that she inherited from her parents in Montmartre but moved into a retirement residence shortly before her death. Her maiden name was Fanny Peyraton. It seems like they did not have any close relatives because there are no obituaries about them published in newspapers or online. There is only very few information available about their family tree. They do not seem to be related to former French Prime minister Edgard Pisani who also came from Corsica and whose surname sounds similar. However it may still be possible to find more details if someone searches through archives or genealogical websites. If you know anything else please feel free to share your knowledge here!

 ### Assistant: Gilberto José Rodríguez Orejuela (born August 3, 1945) was a Colombian drug trafficker and leader of the Cali Cartel. He became known as ""Don Gil"" by his subordinates in Colombia's Medellín cartel. He made US$20 billion from cocaine smuggling between 1978 to 1993. After serving over seven years in prison he has been released on parole since July 26th, 2014. His brother Miguel Rodriguez-Orejuela served time for money laundering charges at FCI Terminal Island before being transferred back into federal custody with Gil. They were both moved together again under new rules after their release dates were extended due to good behavior. Their sentence ends November 1st, 2023 but they could be freed earlier depending upon how much time they have already spent behind bars. The brothers are still considered fugitives despite living openly within walking distance from one another inside Los Angeles County Jail where all visitors must pass through metal detectors first before entering any area outside cells or common areas like recreation yards/gym rooms etc.. It should also be noted that many people believe these two men deserve life sentences without possibility of parole because it would make them eligible for deportation once out if convicted criminals who committed crimes while serving time abroad which includes anything involving drugs even though there isn’t an extradition treaty signed between USA & Colombia yet anyway so technically speaking neither man will ever leave this country alive unless someone else kills him instead!

She played the title role in the sitcom Matlock Police, which ran for six seasons between 1971 and 1978. Her first movie appearance came with a small part as one of four sisters who were kidnapped by escaped convicts in the 1956 crime drama The Shiralee starring Peter Finch and Charles Tingwell. In 1957 she had her breakthrough when she won a major role in the British made TV series Counterspy. It starred Patrick McGoohan as secret agent John Drake. This led to roles in other UK television productions such as Danger Man and Armchair Theatre. Returning home after three years overseas, Fox became known on Australian screens through appearances in shows like Bellbird, Homicide and Division Four. From there she went onto play the lead character in the long running police procedural Matlock Police from 1971 until it finished in 1978. After this she appeared regularly in movies including Summerfield (1977), Stirring Deeply (1978), High Rolling Downs (1979). She also guest-starred in many popular American programs during that period. These included Dallas, Falcon Crest, Magnum PI, Murder She Wrote, JAG and NCIS.

70,"### Human: Who was Sir Theodore Wilson Harris?
 ### Assistant: Sir Theodore Wilson Harris, 1st Baronet (27 July 1845 – 6 January 1930) was a British businessman and politician. He served as the Mayor of Hull from 1902 to 1903. In May 1903 he became Lord Mayor of London for one year, but resigned in April 1904 because his health had worsened after being ill during his mayoralty. From October until December 1904, he served again as Lord Mayor of Hull, this time without taking any money for it. He was knighted on 1 June 1906. His son, Sir George Edward Harris, succeeded him as baronet when he died in January 1930. A statue of Sir Theodore is displayed outside Hull's Guildhall building where he used to work. It shows him wearing a suit with a hat and holding a cane. There are also several other statues around the city which show figures dressed like that era. They were put there by local people who wanted to remember their ancestors or relatives who lived at those times before modern clothes came into fashion. One such statue stands next door to an old pub called ""The Old House"" near Beverley Road railway station. Another statue sits inside St Mary's Church in Anlaby Park. This church dates back over three hundred years ago so you might think they would have made sure someone more famous than just some random person got remembered instead! However, according to legend (which may not be true), when asked why no-one else has been honoured here yet, the vicar replied simply “There’ll always be room!” - meaning there will never be enough space left over once everyone gets buried underground forever...

 ### Assistant: SummerSlam (2016) is a professional wrestling pay-per-view show made by WWE. It happened on August 21, 2016 at Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York and it will be the twenty-ninth SummerSlam event held by the WWF/E since 1988. The official slogan for this year's SummerSlam was ""The Epic Return of Stone Cold Steve Austin"". This would mark his first time appearing on a WWE PPV as an active competitor or commentator since WrestleMania X-Seven. On June 30, 2016, John Cena won Money In The Bank match to get another shot at the WWE World Heavyweight Championship which he lost against AJ Styles earlier that night. After losing to Kevin Owens, he then challenged him to fight each other at SummerSlam where if he wins, he gets the championship while if he loses, he has to leave Raw forever. On July 4, Dean Ambrose defeated Seth Rollins after interference from Chris Jericho with the help of Roman Reigns to win the Intercontinental Championship. Because of this, Ambrose now had three titles under his belt. Later on during the same episode, Triple H announced that Brock Lesnar vs. Randy Orton could happen at SummerSlam but only if both men agreed upon their own terms beforehand. At Battleground, when Kane tried to attack Bray Wyatt through Sister Abigail, Luke Harper came out to stop Kane from doing so. They ended up fighting one another until they were interrupted by Braun Strowman who attacked them both with steel chairs causing all three of them to bleed. As punishment for what they did, all three men have been suspended without pay starting immediately. Then, Triple H said that there would be no more matches between any members of these two groups unless someone else joins either group. During the next episode of Monday Night Raw, Triple H asked Samoa Joe to join Team Authority. When Joe refused, Triple H told him that he can choose whichever member of either team he wants to beat up for not joining Team Authority. Joe chose Kane over Harper because according to him, Kane is weaker than Harper despite being older. While going into a"
72,"### Human: Who was King of England from 8 June 1042 AD to 4 January 1066?
 ### Assistant: Edward the Confessor (13 October, c. 1005 – 5 January 1066) was a king of England who reigned for about thirty-five years and died without an heir at his deathbed in London on January 5th 1066. He is also known as St. Edward because he has been canonized by Roman Catholic Church. His mother's name was Agatha or Editha; his father's name is unknown. It may have been Ethelred II but there are no records that prove this. The only thing we know about him during those first twenty years were that he had gone into exile with his family when Danish raiders attacked Wessex in 1013. This means they would not be able to return until after Alfred the Great defeated them again two years later. After returning home, he lived peacefully under their protection which meant he could go back out hunting whenever he wanted while being protected against any attacks made upon himself personally or even just one member within our household if necessary! In 979, Edward went away from court once more due to illnesses caused by malaria contracted earlier in life so severe it nearly killed him twice already before then too. However, these trips abroad helped develop his interest towards learning languages like French instead English since most people spoke French around him nowadays anyway...and maybe even Latin if possible too depending how far off things got along sometimes.. But all I can say right now is that he spent much time traveling through France where many scholars taught me everything needed learn plus some extra stuff here and there which will come up soon enough hopefully...but let’s get back onto topic shall?.
Edward married three times over course of his life - each wife dying shortly afterwards giving birth either prematurely via miscarriage/stillbirth or postpartum hemorrhage leading eventually resultant loss child(ren). These events took place between 1015–1017 respectively leaving behind him little boys named Godwin & Edmund whom became kings themselves sometime down line later though not necessarily consecutively nor simultaneously mind you!. They were both quite young still however meaning that neither man ever really came close reaching age majority either way..so yeah...that sucked bigtime honestly speaking!! Anyway moving forward briefly momentarily....In 1020 he remarried again marrying Eald"

 ### Assistant: Józef Grudzień (16 February 1928 – 7 November 2020) was a Polish poet, writer and translator. He wrote more than forty books of poetry and prose including the award-winning collection of poems The Man from Nowhere. His works have been translated into several languages such as English, French, Italian or Russian. In Poland he is known for his antiwar poem ""Widziem wroga"". He won many literary awards in his career. He died on 7 November 2020 at the age of ninety two. He was born in Łódź, Poland. Some sources cite that he was born in Warsaw but this has not yet been confirmed by reliable sources. Other sources state that he was born in Piotrków Trybunalski. Both cities are located near each other. In both cases they were all three in Greater Poland Voivodeship. This area is also where most of his life was spent. From 1945 to 1948 he studied at the University of Lodz Faculty of Law and Administration. Between 1948–1953 he worked with publishing houses like Czytelnik, Pax, Książka i Wiedza, Iskry, Wydawnictwo Literackie, Państwowy Instytut Wydawniczy, Ludowa Spółdzielnia Wydawnicza, Znak. After World War II he became an active member of the Union of Polish Youth and later the Socialist People's Party. He began writing during the years immediately following the war. During this time he published some short stories which would be collected together in a book entitled Dziennik z lat 1945-1946 (Diary from Years 1945 - 1946). It includes writings about his experiences living under communism after the end of World War II until it ends around 1948 when he turned twenty. A year before this he had written another diary titled Dziennik z lat 1944/1945 (Diary from Years 1944 / 1945), although no copies survive today. There are rumors that these diaries may still exist somewhere even though there hasn’t been any official confirmation so far. Later on he moved away from politics because"
74,"### Human: Who is the god of water and the sea in ancient Roman religion and mythology?
 ### Assistant: Neptune (, Ancient Greek Νεπτύλης Nephtýlēs), also known as Oceanus or Poseidon was a major deity in many polytheistic religions. He's often seen as the God of Water and Sea by the Romans. The Greeks saw him as one of their twelve Olympians. His symbols are the trident and dolphin. In Homeric poetry he is described as the son of Cronos and Rhea. When his father castrated Uranos with an adamantine sickle made by Athena, Kronos threw all the pieces into the ocean. From there came the Titan Krios who gave birth to Astraios who became the stars while his wife Eurybia bore the seas and sky respectively. Their sons were Pontos ""Sea"" and Gaia ""Earth"". To this day the waters have been called the 'seeds' of life from which all things began. It was said that Neptune had a brother named Pluto, whom he imprisoned inside hell after they fought over Europa. This angered Zeus so much that he took revenge on both brothers. Firstly, he tricked them into fighting each other for control of fire. After defeating him, Neptune fled towards Rome where he settled down at Lake Albano outside the city. There he married Proserpina and ruled alongside her until she died giving birth to Minerva. Then he left the earth and went back to the underworld taking her with him. They say that the only thing that kept him away from returning was when Jupiter sent Mercury to make sure that he never returned again. However, it seems unlikely because some sources say that he still lives near Mount Parnassos. According to Ovid, he has seven daughters - Coral, Nereis, Amymone, Metiscus, Galatea, Thetis, and Melpomene - but these names are not used very frequently except for Thetis who was later turned into a nymph by Apollo. She fell in love with him and tried hard enough to convince him to stay on Earth forever; however, he refused saying that he would rather die than live without seeing his beloved daughter ever again. So instead he offered her immortality if she could turn herself into stone before sunrise every morning. But since then nobody knows what happened next..."

 ### Assistant: Booker T. Jones (born November 12, 1944) is an American musician who was born in Memphis Tennessee and raised there too. He started playing the saxophone when he was a child. In high school his band won many awards for their performances at the Apollo Theater in Harlem New York City. After graduating from High School he went to college where he studied engineering but dropped out of college after one year because he wanted to pursue his career as a singer-songwriter. While still in College he formed The Mar-Keys with some friends which later became known as Stax Records' house band ""The Bar Kays"". They played on most records that were released by Stax during this time period including Sam & Dave’s “Soul Man”; Wilson Pickett’s “In The Midnight Hour”, Otis Redding’s “I Can’t Turn You Loose,” Albert King’s “Born Under A Bad Sign.” Their first album entitled Soul Dressing featured Booker T.’s famous song “Green Onions”. It sold over two million copies worldwide. This made them very popular all around America so they decided it would be good if they got another guitar player named Steve Cropper into their group since then they could have more people writing songs together instead just him doing everything alone beforehand like before now! When I asked what inspired me about my favorite artist/band today—Booker T.—he replied back saying how much influence Jimi Hendrix had given him throughout life while growing up listening every day until recently finding out why everyone loves hearing these types sounds coming through speakers everywhere whenever possible chance arises!!

 ### Assistant: Ronald Ervin ""Ron"" McNair (October 21, 1950 – January 28, 1986) was an American physicist and astronaut. He became a NASA astronaut in April of 1978 and flew on the Space Shuttle Challenger for STS-41B mission from February to March of 1984 as payload specialist. On his second flight he died with six others when Challenger broke apart after launching into space due to failure of O-ring seals in its solid rocket boosters. His remains were buried at Arlington National Cemetery near Washington D.C.. The asteroid 3277 McNair is named after him. In 2007 a documentary movie called When We Were Kings about African Americans in space premiered. It includes information about Dr. McNair's life. A museum dedicated to his memory opened in South Carolina in October 2011. This is located next to Lake Marion where his plane crash occurred during training for that flight. His brother also had a successful career working for NASA including being director of the Johnson Space Center until retiring in 2008. There are many books written by or about this remarkable man who overcame poverty growing up in segregated South Carolina. One such book is Finding the Way Home - The Life Of Astronaut Ron Mcnair by Renee Feltz published by Scribner in 2009. Another is Ron Mcnails Odyssey To Orbit by Richard Reeder, published by Harper Collins Publisher Inc., New York, NY, USA in 1984. Both can be found online through Amazon Books. His brother has written several books which may not have been available years ago but can now be obtained via their websites. Many people will never forget what happened on January 28th, 1986 when we lost one of our brightest stars so early in his promising career. Although it seems like yesterday I remember watching that horrific moment unfold live on television and feeling sickened by knowing how much loss there would soon be for all of us. As someone once said,""We must learn from history before repeating those mistakes again"". Thank you Dr.McNair! You continue inspire us everyday even though your gone...God"
77,"### Human: What is taurine and where does it come from?
 ### Assistant: Taurine (also known as 2-aminoethanesulfonic acid) is an amino sulfonic acid. It exists naturally in the body, but can also be found in foods such as meat or fish. The name comes from its chemical structure; there are two carbon atoms connected to one oxygen atom by a double bond, which connects with another oxygen molecule through single bonds. This forms what looks like a ""taur"" - hence the name. A similar compound called carnitine has been shown to have health benefits for humans. For this reason, some people take supplemental taurine pills when they cannot get enough of their own dietary intake. There are no reported side effects if taken properly according to directions on packaging instructions. However, high doses may cause nausea because your stomach becomes overloaded with water due to increased osmotic pressure caused by excessive amounts being consumed at once instead of spread out throughout several days' worth per day like normal consumption would suggest should happen normally anyway regardless how much you drink daily anyways though either way works just fine too I suppose so long as both ends meet somewhere along those lines somehow eventually sometime somewhere somehow somehowsomewhere etcetera ad infinitum et cetera ad infinitem etc...etc..etc..etc.......etc.....etc............etc..............................etc...............................................................etc............................................................................etc..................................................................................etc....................................................................................................etc....................................................................................................etc....................................................................................................etc....................................................................................................etc....................................................................................................etc....................................................................................................etc....................................................................................................etc....................................................................................................etc....................................................................................................etc....................................................................................................etc....................................................................................................etc....................................................................................................etc....................................................................................................etc....................................................................................................etc....................................................................................................etc....................................................................................................etc....................................................................................................etc....................................................................................................etc....................................................................................................etc....................................................................................................etc....................................................................................................etc....................................................................................................etc....................................................................................................etc....................................................................................................etc................................................................................................"

 ### Assistant: Halabja (Kurdish language name is Hablexane) is an Iraqi Kurdish town in the province of Sulaymaniyah. It had about 50,000 people living there before it suffered from one of history's worst chemical attacks when Saddam Hussein launched a deadly poison gas bombardment against his own citizens on March 16th 1988, killing around 4 thousand and injuring over ten thousands more with many dying later as result of their wounds or illnesses caused by toxic fumes. This event has been known as The Halabja Massacre. It happened after years of war between Iranians & Irakis where both sides were using weapons containing mustard gas which led up till then until this incident occurred due mainly because they couldn’t agree upon how much land each side would have access too while fighting off any invaders who might try entering through either country without permission first being granted! Aftermath
After the massacre, hundreds died and thousands became sick. Many survivors left for other cities such as Erbil or Baghdad but most did not return home again ever since then even though some tried rebuilding what little remained at least partially intact afterwards if only just barely enough so they could live inside once more safely away from danger zones created long ago back when things weren't nearly so bad anymore nowadays thanks largely due mostly likely also partly because those responsible never got caught either way despite all efforts made towards doing something similar somewhere else nearby soon afterwords instead...

She began her career in the early-to mid-1980s and is known for singles such as ""Daddy's Hands"", ""You Really Had Me Going"" and a cover of Fleetwood Mac's ""Don't Stop"". Her first album came out in 1983 on Epic Records. She was born near Dallas, Texas. Dunn died from breast cancer at age fifty eight on November 14, 2016 in Nashville, Tennessee. She had been diagnosed with stage four metastatic disease earlier that year. She left behind two children by ex husband Eddy Raven who she divorced after six years together. They remained close friends until her death. He has said he will be donating his kidneys to one of their daughters when they become old enough to need them. The other daughter is still too young but may also get her fathers organs if needed later down the line. Both girls were raised mostly by Holly herself since birth because it was just the two of them. Their father worked hard to make sure both got everything they wanted growing up so there wasn't much money available once he quit working due to health reasons. Despite this though holly never let anything stop him either. If someone else could help then great but otherwise you do what needs done even if its not always easy or convenient sometimes!

80,"### Human: What is the appearance of the Japanese dwarf flying squirrel?
 ### Assistant: The Japanese dwarf flying squirrel (Pteromys momonga) or Momo, are small nocturnal rodents. They live in forests and grasslands on Honshu Island Japan. Appearance 
The fur is grayish-brown to dark brown with a pale underbelly. There are white patches around its eyes and forehead. Its ears are short, rounded, and hairless. It has large feet adapted for climbing trees. These animals have an average body length from head to tail at about . Their tails make up half their total length. This species weighs between . Most adult males are larger than females. Japanese dwarf flying squirrels can be distinguished by having two pairs of mammae instead of three like most other flying squirrels do. Also unlike any other flying squirrel they lack external ear flaps. Females give birth once per year after a gestation period of about six weeks. Each litter consists of one young only. Juveniles begin eating solid food as early as ten days old but continue nursing until fourteen days later when they start to eat more solid food. Young will leave the nest within seven months of being born. Life span is twelve years or longer. Description 
This species looks similar to North American red tree voles. However, it lacks the vestigial flight muscles that would allow them to glide through the air. Instead these gliding membranes act much like parachutes allowing them to slow down upon landing. The wings are also shorter than those found on North America's northern flying squirrel which allows this species to run faster. Although their bodies look very compact their legs appear long due to the fact that they move quickly while running along branches high above ground level. In addition each foot contains five digits making it easier for them to grip onto narrow twigs. Even though both male and female members of this group tend towards monogamy during breeding season males typically mate with multiple partners over time. When not reproducing all individuals remain solitary except during brief periods such as winter hibernations where several may share shelter space together. During daylight hours many prefer resting quietly inside hollowed out cavities made by insect larvae burrowing beneath rotten logs and stumps rather than exposure themselves directly outside unless absolutely necessary. At nighttime however they emerge into surrounding woods seeking out prey"

 ### Assistant: Ebba Tove Elsa Nilsson (born 29 October 1987), better known by the stage name of Tove Lo, is a Swedish singer-songwriter. She was born in Stockholm to parents from Finland who were living there for work reasons at that time. In an interview with Vogue magazine she said ""I grew up bilingual – Finnish and Swedish – but I identify more as a Swede than anything else"". Her mother is a nurse while her father worked on his own businesses before becoming unemployed when he became ill. When she turned sixteen years old she moved out of home into her boyfriend's flat. A few months later they broke up after which she decided to pursue music fulltime. This led to her moving back home where she lived until she began recording professionally. The first album recorded under this new career choice was Truth Serum released in August 2014. It reached #35 on Billboard's Top Heat Seekers chart. While working on it she also wrote songs for other artists including Icona Pop's single Girlfriend. In November 2014 she signed a contract with Universal Music Group through Polar Pictures Inc., a company owned by producer Max Martin. After signing the deal she went straight onto writing and recording her second studio album Queen of the Clouds which was produced again by Max Martin. It peaked at number three on the US Billboard Hot 200 Chart, selling over one million copies worldwide within its debut week alone.

82,"### Human: Who was Captain Arthur J. Jackson and what did he receive the Medal of Honor for?
 ### Assistant: Captain Arthur J. Jackson (March 26, 1843 – July 7, 1905) was a United States Army officer who received the U.S. military's highest decoration—the Medal of Honor—for his actions at the Battle of Shiloh in Tennessee during April 1862. He is one of only two officers to have been awarded this medal twice; the other being Rear Admiral Samuel F. DuPont. His first award came on September 16, 1862 when he was serving as an acting lieutenant with Company D, 2nd Missouri Light Artillery Regiment. On that date he led a charge against Confederate infantrymen near Corinth, Mississippi. For leading that charge he was brevetted major by President Abraham Lincoln. The second time he would be honored was on December 21, 1864 after he commanded artillery supporting Union troops under Brigadier General James H. Wilson during their attack on Atlanta. It was there that Jackson received a bullet wound which eventually took his life four years later. He died from complications caused by the injury at Fort McPherson outside Atlanta while still serving as chief signal officer of the Western Signal Corps. He was buried in Section 1 of Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia. In addition to his Medals of Honor, Jackson also received the Congressional Gold Medal. This honor has been given to fewer than fifty individuals since it began in 1876. He is the only person ever to hold both medals simultaneously. Only three others were able to earn them more than once. Of those, only two earned all five awards. One of these men was John Henry Winder, who served as a general in the Confederacy but became known as ""The Butcher"" because of his cruel treatment of prisoners-of-war. Because of this reputation, most modern historians believe him to not deserve any credit for receiving the fifth award. That leaves just two people who can claim to truly have won every possible American service medal available to members of the armed forces. Both are now deceased. However, if you want to count the Purple Heart, then there is another living recipient. At age ninety-four he lives today in Washington state. A movie about his experiences called Glory was released in 1989. Denzel Washington played Trip in the film. Morgan"
83,"### Human: Who is Edward Snowden and what did he do?
 ### Assistant: Edward Joseph ""Ed"" Snowden (born June 21, 1983) is an American computer specialist. He worked as a contractor for the Central Intelligence Agency and National Security Agency of the United States government between 2006 to March 2013 when he became famous by revealing thousands of classified US intelligence documents in one of the largest leaks in history. The Guardian newspaper began publishing these secret files on June 5, 2013. These revelations have been described as having caused significant damage to U.S.-Russian relations because it made public that Russian authorities had helped him leave Hong Kong before his arrival at Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport on July 4, 2013. On August 7, 2013, Snowden was granted temporary asylum in Russia until June 2014. In October 2014, the Council of Europe voted not to allow Snowden to be represented there because they thought he should return home. As a result, he lost his right to vote in European elections. At first Snowden said he would like to go back to America but later decided against this idea. When asked about returning to the USA during a press conference with human rights activists in February 2016, Snowden replied ""I will never come back."" Because of all the secrets he revealed while working for NSA, many people think that if Snowden comes back to America then he might get arrested or even executed. However, since President Obama has promised that whistleblowers who are just telling the truth won’t face prosecution under federal law, some experts believe that Snowden could still travel safely through airports without being stopped. It seems likely that once Snowden leaves Russia, he may try living somewhere else where nobody can arrest him such as Ecuador or Venezuela which both offer protection from extradition requests by other countries so long as you don't commit any crimes inside their borders while visiting them either way though it remains unclear how much support those two nations actually give each other regarding matters like international espionage cases involving high-profile figures like himself given past events surrounding Wikileaks founder Julian Assange over alleged hacking charges stemming from Chelsea Mannings leak scandal several years ago now too..

86,"### Human: Who was Galileo Galilei and what is he most remembered for?
 ### Assistant: Galileo Galilei (15 February 1564 – 8 January 1642) was an Italian astronomer, physicist, philosopher, mathematician. He made many important discoveries about the universe that changed people's understanding of it forever. He discovered Jupiter had moons and invented a telescope to look at stars in more detail than ever before. Galileo also studied motion using mathematics which allowed him to make new conclusions on how things moved. His work helped scientists understand the laws of physics better today because they can use these ideas as well! In his later years when being questioned by church officials over some of his beliefs related to religion -he refused to recant any part except one where he said ""The Bible cannot be wrong"". This led directly into conflict with Rome who put pressure upon him until finally dying under house arrest aged eighty-three after spending much time thinking deeply about life itself whilst watching sunsets through prison bars outside his window looking out onto fields filled full beautiful flowers blooming brightly every morning all day long while waiting patiently awaiting death so close now just around corner...and then there was silence......then darkness came again.....but wait no longer my friend soon enough will come another dawn bringing forth hope once more along side peaceful night skies filled up high above us reaching far away beyond reachable limits never ending journey towards eternity unknown destination unknown end point unreached yet still we go forward always searching seeking truth whatever form may take shape appear manifestation revealing self hidden deep inside our hearts minds souls spirits bodies vessels containers holding back secrets kept safe from harm protective walls strong enough stand against storm wind raging wild fire burning hot flames roaring loud sound echoing off distant mountains ranges valleys plains desert dunes oceans seas rivers lakes ponds streams brooks creeks springs fountains waterfalls rapids torrents floods tsunamis hurricanes tornadoes cyclones typhoon blizzards snowstorm icebergs glaciers polar caps frozen ground soil earth surface rock layers crust mantle core molten liquid magma ocean trenches deeps abyss bottomless depths void emptiness nothingness space vast infinity outer reaches edge boundary line limit divide border separation barrier wall blockage obstacle impediment impasse hurdle speed bump roadblock roadblock detour diversion pathway"
87,"### Human: What is Dalby Forest known for?
 ### Assistant: Dalby Forest is a forest in the North Riding of Yorkshire, England. It was once part of an estate owned by Lord Feversham who lived at Duncombe Park near Helmsley. The parkland and woodlands were sold to East Riding County Council as open space under the 1974 Countryside Act. In 2005 it became part of the Forestry Commission's network of National Forests when it merged with its neighbour Sherwood Pines (North Nottinghamshire). Today it covers . There are many different types of trees such as oak, ash, beech, sycamore, larch and Scots pine. It has many footpaths which can also be used on bicycles or horses. One section of path runs through the centre of the forest along the River Derwent from Hutton Rudby. This area is popular because of its proximity to the coastal resorts of Saltburn-By-The Sea and Skinningrove. The village of Newton upon Rawcliffe lies just outside the eastern boundary of the site. The Forest Centre is located within the forest next to the visitor car parks and provides information about the local environment and activities available in the forest. A small museum displays exhibits relating to the history of the Forest including some old farm machinery. There is also a gift shop selling books and maps relating to the area. Adjacent to the Visitor Centres there are picnic areas complete with benches and barbecue facilities. The main visitors centres provide indoor seating and toilet facilities. From here visitors have access to other parts of the forest via marked trails and bridleways. These include the famous 'Bilberry Way', named after one of Britain's most common wild fruits. Bilberries grow abundantly throughout much of the northern half of the UK. They are closely related to blueberries but do not contain any poisonous substances found in their southern counterparts. Other fruiting shrubs that thrive well in these conditions include hazel, blackthorn, rosehip, elderflower and dog rose. All of these species may be seen growing together side by side in this area of the country. The rich soil and good drainage provided by the sandstone bedrock make this an ideal place for them all to flourish. Many people come into the woods each year hoping to find"
88,"### Human: What is a sachet d'épices and how is it used?
 ### Assistant: A sachet d’épices (also called bouquet garni) is an herb bundle, made from fresh or dry leaves. The word means “spice bag”. It is put into the pot when cooking meat to give flavour to foods such as stews, soups, roasts, casseroles etc.. Sachets are also placed in linen bags for storage of clothing before washing them by hand. They were commonly hung on clothes lines across Europe during the 17th century. In France they are known as petits pots de fleur de lavande. This name comes from their use with lavender flowers, which are very fragrant. These little packets can be bought ready-made or you can make your own at home using different types of spices depending on what kind of meal you wish to prepare. You should always keep some small pieces of lemon peel inside your sachet if possible so that no mould forms over time due to lack of air circulation within its confines! Make sure not too many things go into one container though because then there will simply become too much liquid present which could cause problems downstream once everything starts being boiled together again later on… 
The most common way of making this type of item would probably involve taking two cotton squares measuring roughly around five inches wide each side respectively; folding both sides upwards towards themselves until reaching about halfway through whereupon we wrap our mixture tightly between these sheets until sealing off all potential holes/gaps along edges whereby nothing escapes out anymore either... Then tie securely shut using twine string knotted firmly enough yet still flexible enough allowing us access whenever required without having anything burst open accidentally while doing so.... If desired extra ingredients may include saltpeter powdered form mixed well throughout contents prior placing back into place just before finalizing process altogether ensures best results achieved every single time round!.

89,"### Human: Who was Idanell Brill Connally?
 ### Assistant: Idanell Brill Connally (née Brill; November 23, 1907 – October 5, 2016) was an American socialite and philanthropist. She was the wife of John B. Connally Jr., who served as Governor of Texas from 1963 to 1969 and United States Secretary of the Treasury under President Richard Nixon in 1971-1972. She also worked for Lyndon Johnson during his presidential campaigns. Her son is former U.S. Senator John B. Connally III and her daughter is Nancy Connally. She died on October 5, 2016 at a hospital in Dallas, aged 108. At the time of her death she was thought to be one of the oldest living people born in the United States. The title went to Emma Morano after Connally's death. However, this has been disputed by some sources. In April 2014, it was reported that Mary Louise Cecil had become America’s oldest person alive after being confirmed as older than both Connally and Morano. According to records kept by Gerontology Research Group, however, all three women were listed as having been born on Nov. 23, 1907. This means they could not have been more than two days apart in age when each reached their centennial birthdays last year. All three are believed to still hold the record today based upon current information available about them. They may well share the honor until someone else comes along with documentation proving otherwise. But if you look closely enough at what we know so far, there seems little doubt which lady deserves top billing. And according to Wikipedia page on Connaly ""She became the third known woman ever born before January 1st 1907 to reach 110 years old"". There is no source cited though. So maybe she did live longer but just never made it into Guinness Book Of Records or other similar publications due lack of proper evidence. Either way - whatever happened between these ladies over past few decades remains unknown even now! As much fun guessing games go here... :-) Edit : I found another reference saying that Mary Louise Cecil was born Feb 14th 1907 making her younger than everyone else mentioned above except perhaps Emma Morano who"

 ### Assistant: Plummer is a city in Benewah County, Idaho. The 2010 census reported that it had a population of 769 people and was ranked as one of the least populated cities in the United States by Forbes magazine. Geography
Plummer has an area of . According to the U.S Census Bureau's 2004-2008 American Community Survey, there were 532 households out of which 24% have children under the age of 18 living with them, 56% are married couples living together, 6% have a female householder with no husband present, and 35% are non-families. 31% of all households are made up of individuals and 18% have someone living alone who is 65 years old or older. The average household size is 2.25 and the average family size is 2.83. There are 255 single parents (males) and 108 widows (female). Average income for males over the age of 15 is $25,250 while females make $18,542 per year on average. The median income for a household is $32,250 annually while the mean income for a family is $38,400 per year. Males make about $31,607/year versus $18,583/year for women. About 11% of families and 17% of the population live below the poverty line including 21% of those less than 18 and 16% of those aged 65 or more. Most residents speak English at home but Spanish language proficiency rates higher among immigrants. All of these figures come from the 2004–2008 survey. In October 2011, Plumber had only two traffic signals installed along US Highway 95. These lights controlled northbound and southbound traffic. This system cost approximately $6 million dollars. It was funded through federal money administered by the Federal Highway Administration. The project took almost three years to complete before being opened in early September 2011. As of November 2011, the town still does not have any streetlighting. Some streets do have light poles,"

92,"### Human: What is a bistro and what kind of food do they serve?
 ### Assistant: A Bistro is a restaurant which serves simple, inexpensive dishes. They are often French but may be found all over the world. The name comes from the French word meaning ""little café"".  In general, these restaurants have little decoration or furniture and no tablecloths on the tables; it's meant to look like an old-fashioned Parisian cafeteria with small tables and chairs. Most places offer only one type of cuisine (usually French), although some will add other types such as Italian or Chinese if there's enough demand for them. Some people say that true bistros don't use reservations because everyone should feel welcome at any time during their visit. Others disagree about this point since many high end establishments still require advance bookings due to limited seating capacity limits imposed by local laws governing licensed premises serving alcoholic drinks without meals being served alongside those offered elsewhere within the same building complexes owned/operated under common ownership rules applied equally across all business units operated throughout various geographical regions spread out widely across urban landscapes nationwide today around our great country here in America!

95,"### Human: What happens to the body during starvation?
 ### Assistant: Starving means that a person or animal does not have enough food. The human body needs many different nutrients, such as protein and carbohydrates (sugars), in order for it to work properly. If there is no food available, then eventually the body will run out of these things. This causes death because all cells need energy from sugar to survive. When people are starved they may lose weight but if this continues long term their bodies can start eating away at muscle tissue which is also an important source of energy. After about 2 weeks without any calories being consumed by mouth, a starving individual's brain starts using its own fat reserves for fuel. In extreme cases where very little water has been taken in with the food, kidney function ceases and waste products build up in bloodstream causing damage throughout the rest of the body. Eventually organ failure sets in and the heart stops beating leading to death due to lack of oxygen supply across other organs like lungs etc., resulting in cardiac arrest followed shortly after by respiratory arrest. However even though some parts of our bodies stop working when we don’t eat anything anymore -such as digesting proteins- others continue working normally until there isn't much left inside us except bones and skin!
This process usually takes around three months before someone dies naturally via dehydration/starvation unless they find something else soon afterwards like food scraps lying nearby somewhere outside town walls perhaps... But let me tell you how I know what happens next so far ahead of time—because my sister told me everything she read online while sitting right here beside me just now reading over her shoulder too fast sometimes making mistakes along way through whole article written below.....and yes okay maybe she did say ""I'm sorry"" once few times already today anyway....so yeah thanks Momma <3 
There was another reason why most animals do not die of hunger alone; namely, the fact that man cannot exist on bread alone. It must be remembered that man requires more than simple foodstuffs for his existence. He requires air to breathe, sunlight to see by, warmth to keep him comfortable, and shelter against inclement weather conditions. And although he needs sleep occasionally, he does not require it every day nor night. His physiological requirements make him less dependent upon food supplies than animals generally are. Man is able to store large"

He played as a centre-half in the Football League for Manchester City, Tranmere Rovers and Chester during the 1960s. His father William also played professional football for several clubs including Blackpool and Swansea Town. Hayes was born in Manchester, Lancashire. In his career he made over 80 appearances in total scoring four goals. After retiring from playing, Hayes managed at non league level with Nantwich Town, Runcorn FC Halton and New Brighton.

97,"### Human: What is the chemical formula and properties of bismuthine?
 ### Assistant: Bismuthine, also known as dibismutene or bis(methyl)bismuth, is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is Bi2H6. It contains bismuth in its +4 oxidation state. The bonding between atoms are covalent. Properties 
Bis(methyl)bismuth reacts with water to make hydrogen gas (H2). It can dissolve in ammonia but not in alcohol. If it does get into an alcohol solution, it will be reduced back to metallic bismuth by zinc metal. This reaction makes ZnHgBi alloy which has very good electrical conductivity because each atom contributes one electron for conduction. When heated above about , it becomes solid again and releases methane gas instead of hydrogen gases like before when dissolved in water alone. Because this happens at such high temperatures though so most people would just use pure acids on their samples if they want them to decompose without burning up first from heat generated during decomposition process itself anyway though there's no reason why couldn't do that too since those same reactions take place under acid conditions too actually...just takes longer time period usually due to lower rate constants involved here compared against what occurs via thermal decomposition pathway mentioned earlier either way works fine either way really doesn't matter all that much once you know how things work out ahead-of-time anyways . So basically we have some pretty cool stuff going down here folks! Hopefully everyone enjoys reading through these articles just as much as I did writing them ;) Cheers guys!!

98,"### Human: Who was Mary Holt and what were her notable achievements?
 ### Assistant: Mary Holt (1920 – 3 May 2016) was a British politician. She served as the Member of Parliament for Birmingham Ladywood from 1974 to 1987, representing both the Labour Party and Social Democratic Party during this time period. In October 1975 she became Minister without Portfolio in James Callaghan's government but resigned after less than two months when Callaghan called an election which resulted in his party losing its majority. From September 1976 until March 1977 she held the position of Lord Privy Seal under Harold Wilson before becoming Shadow Secretary of State for Education & Science in July 1977, serving under Michael Foot until 1980. As MP for Birmingham Ladywood, she campaigned against racism and sex discrimination. After leaving parliament, she continued working on women’s issues. She died at home near Bristol on 3 May 2016 aged 96 years old. Her death was announced by her daughter-in-law, Nicola Hodgson. The cause of death is not known publicly yet. A memorial service will be held later this year. It will take place in London. There are plans to hold another event next summer in Birmingham. This would also include other events throughout England. These events are being organised with help from the University of Birmingham Women's Liberation Group. They have been planning them since January 2016. She left behind three children, seven grandchildren, six great-grandchildren and one sister. At the age of ninety four, she still had a lot planned. She said ""I want people to know I am alive"". She went on to say that she wanted to continue writing about politics. She hoped to finish some articles she began working on while she was living in Bristol. She wrote a book entitled 'Britain Under Thatcher'. She did so because it gave her a chance to speak out about how bad things really got once Margaret Thatcher took office. She talked about many different subjects such as education reform and nuclear weapons policy. She believed these topics should remain relevant today due their importance back then. Some believe they may become even more important tomorrow depending upon who wins power hereafter. If you enjoy reading books like those mentioned above please consider purchasing copies online or visiting local libraries where possible! Thank"
