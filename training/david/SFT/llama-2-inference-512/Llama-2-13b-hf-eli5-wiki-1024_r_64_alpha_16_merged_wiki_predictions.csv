 ### Assistant: The 7.62×39mm (also called .30 M1948) is a rifle cartridge used in the AK-47, SKS and other weapons. It was designed by Mikhail Kalashnikov in the late 1940s for use with the Soviet Union's new assault rifles. It has been made since then by many countries all over the world. Its design makes it easy to make on small machines that are not very precise. This means they can be built even when there is no good way to get parts from another country. This also keeps its price down so more people can afford guns. Also, this makes it possible to build them without having permission from anyone else first. Because of these reasons, most ""assault rifles"" today still shoot bullets like those made for the original AK-47 or SKS models. Today, however, some modern versions have better accuracy than older ones because their barrels are longer than before and they don’t need as much powder behind each bullet anymore thanks to improvements in propellant technology during recent decades! The round itself uses an FMJ bullet which means it will go straight through your target instead of breaking apart inside him/her like hollow point rounds do if you hit something soft enough such as flesh tissue instead of bone marrow etcetera... All things considered though; unless someone wants something extremely accurate at long distances then there really isn’t any reason why anyone would choose anything but standard ammo anyway due solely based upon cost effectiveness alone.... So basically what we learned here today was that sometimes less really does mean more depending upon where exactly within society one happens currently reside geographically speaking i suppose..????? LOL!!!!! JUST KIDDING GUYS!!!! ;) No seriously tho.... I hope yall enjoyed reading my post & found value somewhere somehow along the line while doing so!! :) Cheers everybody stay safe out there ok ????

2,"### Human: What was the name of the French colony that later became the Republic of Dahomey?
 ### Assistant: The Kingdom of Porto-Novo (or sometimes called as Kingom of Whydah) was a French colony in Africa. It was on the Gulf of Guinea, and it is now known as Benin.  In 1958, it got its independence from France and changed its name to the Republic of Dahomey. This lasted until 1972 when it changed again to become the People's Republic of Benin before becoming just plain old Benin. Its capital city is Port Novo, which has been there since at least 1640. Before this time, its capital had been Abomey. Today, both cities are still important centres for trade and industry in the country. They also have many historical sites such as museums or palaces where you can see how people lived hundreds years ago. These places attract tourists who want to learn more about history while having fun too! If you’re interested in visiting these two beautiful towns then check out our blog post below:
 
 
 
The kingdom of Porto-Novo was created by the Portuguese explorer Pedro Alvares Cabral during his voyage around West Africa between 1503–1504. He named it after an island off Cape Verde where he first landed before heading south along what would eventually be called ""the coast"" (i.e., Brazil). After arriving back home safely but without any gold ore found anywhere near him—Cabral decided not only did God want him alive so much that even though no one else knew where exactly they were going; if anyone tried anything against me... well let them try because I will make sure none survive nor escape unscathed--he went ahead with plans anyway despite all odds being stacked against him due primarily thanks mainly towards Spanish ships blockading ports preventing supplies getting through unless paid handsomely enough amounts demanded otherwise......and thus began another chapter within European colonialism throughout world history books written today.........which brings us full circle back once again onto topic at hand here namely regarding origins/beginnings etcetera ad infinitum et ceteramus maximus cum laude magnanimus prodigious praise unto thee o great king of kings supreme ruler over all lands everywhere upon earth forever amen!!!

3,"### Human: What is the name and some characteristics of a moon of Saturn?
 ### Assistant: Pan (moon) or S/2018 S 4, is an inner non-spherical moon of Saturn. It was found by Scott Sheppard, David Jewitt, Jan Kleyna, and Brian Marsden in 2019 from observations taken between April and June 2017. Pan is about 3 kilometers across, and orbits Saturn at an average distance of 156,468 Mm in 8 hours and 1 minute. Its rotation period has not been determined yet because its orbit is inclined with respect to Saturn's equator. This means that it can only be seen for short periods as Saturn rotates. Because it is so small and close to Saturn, there are no known images of Pan. The surface temperature is estimated to be around 90 K. It may have formed along with other moons like Daphnis and Atlas, which also have retrograde orbits near the edge of Saturn's rings. In Greek mythology, Pan was the god of shepherds and flocks who played panpipes. He was one of the first gods created by Zeus. His mother was the nymph Penelope. Pan had many children with various partners including Echo, Oreithyia, and others. There were several ancient temples dedicated to him. One famous temple was on Mount Parnassos where Apollo killed him after he tried to seduce his daughter, Coronis. The goddess Artemis saved her child, Asklepios, while inside her womb. When she gave birth, he became the god of medicine. Another story says that Pan once fell in love with Hygea, the goddess of health and cleanliness. They made love but when they did, all the animals on earth stopped reproducing. Finally, Hermes took away Pan's virility using magic. Pan then died and was buried underneath the ruins of Olympus. Later, he returned as a spirit called Bromios. A statue of Pan was built in Rome during the reign of Augustus Caesar. Emperor Nero burned down much of the city, but this statue survived until Christianity spread through Europe. After that time, few statues depicting pagan deities remained standing except those dedicated to Athena. However, these too disappeared over time due to natural disasters"
4,"### Human: What is the Rambla de las Ovejas and where is it located?
 ### Assistant: The Rambla de las Ovejas (in English, ""Rambla of the Sheep"") is a natural gorge in Spain. It is on the south side of Mount Aitana in the Province of Alicante. Its name comes from an old tradition that sheep used to be herded through this area during springtime when they were taken up into the mountains for summer grazing. This route was called la ruta de las ovejas (""the sheepherders' path""). Today there are many hiking routes along the riverbed of the stream which flows down the mountain. These paths have been named after the different towns around the gorge such as Altea, Benidorm, Polop de La Marina or Alfaz del Pi. The gorge itself has become popular with tourists who come here to enjoy its beauty while walking along one of these trails. There are also several restaurants serving typical dishes made using fresh ingredients grown locally. One restaurant even offers free Wi-Fi access so visitors can check emails before heading home! In addition to providing refreshments for weary travelers; some cafes provide live music performances every weekend throughout July & August each year making them ideal places to spend time relaxing surrounded by nature without having too much trouble finding parking spaces nearby due their proximity towards major roads leading out toward other parts of Costa Blanca region including Torrevieja town centre only 10 minutes away via car ride away depending upon traffic conditions at any given moment. From Benidorm you will need approximately half hour drive but if going directly north then just over twenty minutes should do nicely enough unless stuck behind slow moving vehicles blocking progress altogether causing further delay until finally reaching destination point safely arrived unharmed intact albeit somewhat tired perhaps still thirsty wanting something cool refreshing drink afterwards maybe ice cream dessert treat option available too choose between chocolate vanilla strawberry flavours whatever preferences dictate tastes buds craving hunger pangs satisfied eventually contented happy satiated feeling full bellies bloating abdomen distended expanding stretching digestive system functioning properly operating normally performing efficiently smoothly running orderly fashion according plan design specifications laid ahead scheduled timetable accordingly following guidelines instructions provided previously agreed terms conditions prior arrangements confirmed mutually understood agreements reached satisfactory manner acceptable standard acceptable quality sufficient quantity sufficient size suitable form shape colour texture taste smell od"
5,"### Human: What is an anvil used for?
 ### Assistant: An anvil (or smithy's anvil) is a large block of metal, usually iron or steel. It has been in use since the Iron Age and was one of the most important tools for blacksmithing. The top part of the anvil is hardened to make it stronger than the rest of the anvil. This makes it possible to hammer on it without damaging it too much. A good anvil can last hundreds of years if well cared for. Nowadays anvils are mostly made from cast steel. They come in different sizes depending on what they will be used for. Larger anvils were also used as hammers by workers who needed more power than could fit into their hands. Anvils are still sometimes used today but not nearly as often because modern technology allows us to do things faster and better with less effort which means that we don’t need them anymore except when working with heavy metals like copper or lead where only an anvil would work properly due its weight being enough pressure against whatever material you want cut through before breaking apart completely after just one strike! However there may still exist some places around world where these old fashioned methods remain popular even though newer ones have taken over almost everywhere else nowadays so don’t forget about those either!! 🙂 ☺️ ❤️ ♥️ ☀️ 🌞 💪 🔨 🛠️ 📦 🚁 🐑 🍷 🏮 🇯🇵 🎈 🥳 🎉 🎊 🎆 🎗 🎖 🎽 🧭 🧰 🧩 🧫 🧬 🧴 🧶 🧸 🧺 🧻 🧼 🧾 🧿 🧽 🧾 🧿 🧾 🧿 🧾 🧿 🧾 🧿 🧾 🧿 🧾 �"

8,"### Human: Who is King Kong and what is his role in movies and other media?
 ### Assistant: King Kong (also known as K. Kong, Big Ape or The Eighth Wonder of the World) is a fictional gorilla who has appeared in many books, comics, video games, television shows, theme park rides and 3D rides at Universal Studios Hollywood and Islands of Adventure since 1933 when he was first seen on screen. He usually fights dinosaurs and humans to protect his jungle home from them. In most versions of this story, he falls in love with Fay Wray's character Ann Darrow but dies after being shot by airplanes. His son Junior Kong also appears in some stories. He was voiced by Frank Welker for the animated series King Kong: The Animated Series which ran for one season between September 8, 2000 - March 27, 2001 on ABC Family Channel and later Cartoon Network in April 4, 2005-May 6, 2005. He is currently owned by Warner Bros., Legendary Entertainment, DreamWorks Animation and Paramount Pictures because they bought out RKO Radio Pictures in 1984. However, it should be noted that Universal owns the rights to produce any future films based on King Kong under its current deal with Legendary. This includes remakes of previous King Kong films made before 1984 including Peter Jackson's 2005 remake. It is believed that these companies will not make another movie about him until sometime around 2020 due to how successful their last film was despite mixed reviews from critics worldwide; however there are rumors saying otherwise so we can only wait & see if anything happens soon enough! There were actually two different incarnations during production called ""Godzilla"" & then eventually changed into something else entirely altogether afterwards though...so don't worry too much just yet folks!!

Krachkovskaya died on 30 September 2020 at her home in St. Petersburg, aged 61. Her death is believed to have been caused by suicide. She had suffered from depression for several years. Krachkovskaya's body was found three days later when neighbors became concerned about her not being seen outside since August. The police are investigating her cause of death. Krachkovskaya left no will or notes behind. There were rumours that she may have been murdered but this has not been confirmed yet. An autopsy was scheduled for October 7. Her funeral took place on October 13. It was attended by many celebrities who paid tribute to her life. Actress Elena Koreneva said ""Natalya made an indelible mark on our hearts."" One newspaper described her as one of the most talented Russian actors ever. Another called her ""one of the best actresses"". Some people remembered how nice she always was. Others wrote about how beautiful she looked even though she did not wear makeup often. Many fans still cannot believe that she killed herself because they say it does not fit into their image of her personality. They want more information before drawing any conclusions. Krachkovskaya's mother said ""She loved life so much"" while speaking to reporters after learning what happened to her daughter. She added ""I can only hope now that God forgives me my sins too."" Friends also talked about how kind-hearted she was towards others during difficult times"

11,"### Human: What is the format of MPEG-1 and/or MPEG-2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)?
 ### Assistant: MP3 is a lossy audio compression method. It was created in Germany, by the Moving Pictures Expert Group (MPEG). The first version to be made publicly available was Version 0.5, which came out on October 7th, 1991. This file type has been used for many years now. There are different versions of it that have come out since then. Most people use the MPEG-1 or MPEG-2 Audio Layer 3 (also called mp3) version. The standard for this kind of audio encoding can be found here . It uses an extension of ID3 tags. It supports VBR (Variable Bit Rate), CBR (Constant Bit Rate), and ABR (Adaptive Bit Rate). Its bit rate ranges from kbps to 320 kbps. If you want more information about how it works, click here. The original mpeg4a files were not very good quality so they had to change their name because if you google ""mp3"" most of what comes up is bad music. Now when someone searches ""mp3"", they will find mostly high quality songs instead of low quality ones like before. So don't worry! You won't get fooled into downloading something terrible anymore thanks to this new update!. The reason why there aren’t any real differences between these two formats besides being able to play one better than another due to hardware limitations such as RAM memory size etc., is because both types use exactly same algorithm but with slightly different settings applied during encoding process; therefore resulting similar sound output after decoding stage completed successfully without errors occurring along way.. One thing worth mentioning though would probably include lack support for surround systems while listening through headphones might still work fine even though some minor distortions occur occasionally depending upon what type headphone used currently connected device via USB port located inside computer case housing internal components including motherboard itself.""
Mp3 is a digital audio format designed to compress large amounts of data. It does this by reducing the amount of bits needed per second, making it possible to store more songs on your phone or laptop. However, this also means that mp3s lose some fidelity compared to CDs or other uncompressed sources like WAV files. For example, when playing back an old vinyl record at home using speakers instead of headphones (which are much less sensitive), there may be some hissing"

 ### Assistant: The Walt Disney Concert Hall is a concert hall in Downtown Los Angeles, California. It opened on October 24, 2003. Frank Gehry designed it. Its shape was inspired by a group of sailboats called jachts and other watercraft. There are two halls inside the building. One has seats for an audience that can hold up to about 2,195 people at one time; this is where most shows take place. The second room holds only 400 chairs so there isn't much space between them. This area also includes practice rooms as well as offices where musicians work together when they aren’t performing live music events like operas or symphonies. These areas allow artists who come from all over America (and sometimes even Europe) access during their stay here because many don't have enough money left after paying rent elsewhere while waiting around until someone needs some help with something related directly towards getting ready before going home again later down south somewhere closer than New York City which would cost too much gasoline just driving back & forth every weekend unless you wanted your car broken into multiple times per year due solely due lackluster security measures taken against thieves breaking into vehicles parked outside buildings owned privately rather publically accessible ones located within close proximity eachother across town anywhere else besides downtown LA itself specifically speaking though since we already know what happens next...

 ### Assistant: Katrin Tobin (born 1974) is a German-American actress. She was born in Hamburg, Germany and raised in the United States. In 2005 she won an Emmy Award for her role as ""Lena"" on the HBO show Carnivàle. In addition to television work, Tobin has acted in movies such as The Dark Knight Rises (2012), Captain America: Civil War (2016), Justice League (2017). Since September 3rd of this year, she played Mina Haverdink in the Netflix series Dahmer - Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story. It tells about serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer's life and crimes. She also plays Lydia Brewton in the Paramount+ limited drama series Tulsa King starring Sylvester Stallone. This will premiere later this month. Tobin lives with her husband and two children in Los Angeles. She speaks English and German fluently. Her mother tongue is German but since childhood she only spoke English at home. After moving to the USA, she learned how to read and write again in English. Her hobbies are cooking and yoga. On Instagram, she shares many pictures from these activities. She loves dogs very much and owns one herself. As well as acting, she likes to travel and spend time outdoors. For example, she often goes camping or climbing mountains with friends. In general, she enjoys being active and exploring new places whenever possible! Tobin is known for playing strong female characters who aren’t afraid to stand up for themselves against powerful men—something that resonates strongly with audiences today given recent events like #MeToo movement against sexual harassment/abuse etc.. When asked why she thinks people connect so deeply with these types of roles said “I think because they see someone standing up against something bigger than themself.” That idea really struck me when I first started working on my character in The Handmaid's Tale...it felt empowering knowing there were others fighting alongside us even though we weren't physically together."" At present, it seems likely that more projects featuring strong women led by talented actors like Tobin will continue appearing across screens large small alike going forward into future seasons ahead....and hopefully beyond too!.

 ### Assistant: Maria Magdalena kyrka (or St. Mary Magdalen Church) is a church building in the Vasastaden district, in central Stockholm, Sweden. The church was built between 1906 and 1907 by architect Sigge Cronstedt after plans from Lars Israel Wahlman. It has room for about 850 people. In the beginning it had only one tower but when they expanded it with an extra floor, they also added another tower on top. When you walk into the church there are three entrances; two at each side and one straight ahead. On both sides there are statues that symbolize faith and hope respectively. There's also some stained glass windows that represent different saints or biblical scenes like Jesus Christ resurrecting Lazarus from death as well as other stories related to Christianity such as Noah saving his family during floodwaters etcetera...

16,"### Human: What is the genre of music that Behemoth plays?
 ### Assistant: Behemoth is a blackened death metal band from Poland. The band was formed in 1991, and have released eight studio albums since then. They play what has been called ""satanic"" or ""evil-themed"" extreme metal. Their lyrics are about war, Satanism, anti-Christianity, antisemitism, blasphemy, murder, violence, sex, drug abuse, alcoholism, occult themes, nihilism and politics. All their songs contain some form of satire. Many people believe they worship Satan because of this. This makes many Christians angry with them for not following Christian beliefs. Other bands such as Slayer also sing about these topics but do not get treated like this. This may be due to racist views on Polish people being common in America during the time when Behemoth started playing music. It could also be because most Americans do not know much about Poland's history. Most members of Behemoth are Catholic Christians who practice their religion regularly. Some fans think it would make sense if Nergal (the lead singer) did something else besides just singing about evil things all day long; maybe he should go out more often instead! He might even meet someone nice while doing so...

17,"### Human: Who is Marvin Ronald Lewis and what is his role in the National Football League?
 ### Assistant: Marvin Ronald Lewis (born October 29, 1963) is an American football coach. He was head coach of the Cincinnati Bengals from 2003 to 2018. From 1994 through 2001 he worked for the Baltimore Ravens as a defensive coordinator under Ray Lewis. He also played college football at Maryland. In 2017 he became only the fifth NFL coach to win 50 games with one team after losing 50 or more. The other four are Chuck Knox, Dick Vermeil, Mike Shanahan, and Tom Landry. His record against Bill Belichick's New England Patriots teams during this time period stands at 6–14 (.300). After the 2018 season ended, it was announced that Lewis would not return as head coach next year. On January 3, 2019, Lewis stepped down as head coach of the Bengals. Lewis will be replaced by Hue Jackson who will serve as interim head coach until Zac Taylor can take over in February. However on May 3rd, 2019 it has been reported that Lewis has accepted a job offer from the Arizona Cardinals as their new Defense Coordinator replacing James Bettcher. This came about because former Head Coach Steve Wilks had already been fired months earlier due to poor performance. It is unknown if Lewis will stay with the Cardinals once they hire their next Head Coach. That being said however it seems unlikely since there have been reports of tension between him and current General Manager Steve Keim which could lead to Lewis leaving sooner than later. As of right now though nothing official has come out yet so we cannot say anything definitively until then but keep checking back here for updates! Update: According to ESPN reporter Adam Schefter, Marvin Lewis has signed a contract extension worth $6 million per year making him the highest paid assistant coach in all sports history! This makes sense considering how successful he’s been throughout his career especially when you look at some past examples such as John Harbaugh ($5M), Sean Payton($5M), Andy Reid($4M), etc.. So congratulations go out again to Mr Lewis on achieving another milestone within our beloved sport!! Go Bengals!!! Note : There were rumors circulating recently"

 ### Assistant: Hiro Yamamoto (born March 12, 1960) is an American musician. He plays the bass guitar for the grunge band Soundgarden. In early 1985 he was replaced by Ben Shepherd and left the group to pursue a career as a chef. Yamamoto returned to play with Soundgarden at their reunion concerts in 2010. In January 2014, it was announced that he would be leaving Soundgarden again due to health problems. However, in November of the same year, he rejoined the band during some shows on the King Animal tour. On May 3, 2017, he reunited once more with Soundgarden to perform ""Black Rain"" live on Jimmy Kimmel Live!. The song appeared on the album Badmotorfinger released in October 1991. Yamamoto has been diagnosed with cancer. As of February 2021, his condition remains unknown. In September 2021, he was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame with the rest of the original members of Soundgarden. They were unable to attend because they could not reach an agreement about how much each member should get paid from ticket sales. At the ceremony, Kim Thayil performed solo while Chris Cornell's vocals played over the speakers. Matt Cameron did not participate either. It marked the first time since 2014 that all three surviving members had appeared together publicly. In December 2021, Yamamoto revealed through Facebook that he was suffering from stage four pancreatic cancer. Despite this, he said that he wanted to continue making new music. His last show with Soundgarden took place on August 11, 2019 at Lollapalooza Chile. During the performance of ""Black Hole Sun"", he can be seen smiling and dancing along with the crowd. In late July 2022, Yamamoto died at age sixty-two after battling cancer. He was survived by his wife Karen, two sons, sister and brother. His death came five years after the suicide of lead singer Chris Cornell and sixteen months after drummer/backup vocalist Matt Cameron also joined him in retirement following the departure of frontman Kim Thayil earlier in the month.

She was a wife of shogun Ashikaga Takauji, who had three sons with him: Yoshinori, Tadayoshi, and Noritane. In 1429 she became empress consort when Emperor Go-Komatsu abdicated in favour of his son, Go-Hanazono, but died only nine years later. Her mausoleum is at Kyoto's Rokuoin Temple. It is called . The tomb has been designated an Important Cultural Property by the Japanese government since 1979. After her death, she received the name Kenshūin Daigon-ni, or Great Pure Wisdom. This posthumous title means that she is honoured alongside other members of the imperial family. In addition, she received another title: Shukakuin Daikeisho, which translates as ""Great Virtuous Consort"". In total, she has five titles after her death. Two more have been added over time: Jokoin Taishi (""Glorious Sage"") and Gokanshin-nyogo (""Sovereign Mother""). These two last titles are unique for women from the imperial court. They were created because Masako supported her husband during the Muromachi period. There are some other titles like this one, too. For example, Nijō Morotsugu got them in the early Edo period. He helped Tokugawa Ieyasu become shogun. However, it took nearly four hundred years until someone else besides Masako got these special titles. That person was Princess Tomohime. She lived between 1597 and 1632. During her life, she helped her brother, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, unite Japan under the rule of the Imperial Court. Today, there are many statues dedicated to Masako. One of them can be found inside the temple where she was buried. Another statue stands outside the Rokuoin gate. It was built about sixty years ago and shows Masako holding a lotus flower in both hands. A third sculpture depicting Masako can be seen on the grounds of the Kiyomizudera temple. It dates back to the Meiji era, making it almost"
20,"### Human: What is a domain name and what are some common domain name extensions?
 ### Assistant: A domain name (or web address) is the location of a website. It tells where to find it on the internet. For example, ""www.wikipedia.org"" can be typed into an Internet browser like Google Chrome or Safari. The extension at the end shows which country that site belongs in. Some examples of these include .com for commercial websites, .gov for government sites, and .edu for educational ones. There are over 200 different types of top-level domains available today. They vary from countries such as .uk or .fr to categories like .net or .info. In addition to this list there exist many other lesser known TLDs used by organizations worldwide including those ending with 'xn--' or 'academy'. These often have no meaning outside their respective language/culture group but serve important functions within them nonetheless! Examples would be '.de' Germany; '.ru' Russia etcetera.. Domain names can also refer to IP addresses directly without any need for subdomains underneath yours if you so choose - just make sure your registrar allows it beforehand though since most don’t allow this practice anymore due security concerns associated with using shortened versions instead of full ones when registering new domains online nowadays.” You should not use special characters while creating one unless absolutely necessary because they might cause problems during registration process later down line too depending upon who manages said registry services themselves – again check first please!!

21,"### Human: What is a shotgun and how does it work?
 ### Assistant: A shotgun (also called scatter gun) is a firearm that shoots many small pellets at once. It fires the projectiles from a smoothbore barrel, which means the inside of the tube has no grooves or rifling. This makes the shots spread out as they go through the air instead of staying in one line like bullets fired by a rifle do. The shells are usually made up of metal cases with powder and either lead balls or steel ""shot"" in them. Shotguns have been used for hunting since long before guns were invented. They were originally called fowlers because people mostly used them to hunt birds such as ducks and geese. Over time, their use expanded to include larger game animals such as deer, moose, elk and bear. Today there are more than 20 million registered shotguns in America alone! In fact, if you add together all of those guns into one big pile then it would be about half an hour's drive away from where I live right now...so yeah..that's kinda crazy isn't it? But anyway back on topic; what exactly makes these things so effective when compared against other types of weapons? Well first off let me explain why using bullets isn't always practical depending on your situation - especially if someone is trying kill/maim/steal something valuable from us humans who don't want anyone else getting hurt while we protect ourselves against potential threats coming towards our homes etcetera....which brings me nicely onto another point here namely 'why not just shoot someone dead?'

 ### Assistant: Jörg Michael (born 23 April, 1963) is a German musician. He was born in Düsseldorf, Germany. His main instrument is drums. He has played with many bands of the Power Metal scene such as Rage or Stratovarius. He is known for being one of the pioneers of this style. In the early eighties he joined Paradox where he recorded their first album ""Electric Eye"". After that, he became part of Running Wild, recording two albums (""Under Jolly Roger"" & ""Black Hand Inn""). Then, after leaving them, he formed his own band Cacumen along with vocalist Peavy Wagner from Rage. With them he released three studio albums and an EP before disbanding in 1987. The same year he got together with Victor Smolski and Peter Pichl to form a new project called Lingua Mortis Orchestra which would be short-lived due to the departure of both members soon afterwards. But it wasn't until late '80s when Michael decided to join forces again with Peavy Wagner forming another heavy metal act called Grave Digger. Together they made five records over six years including classics like ""The Reaper"", ""Tunes Of War"" and ""Knights Of The Cross"". However at some point during this time period Michael left the group because of personal issues. By then he had already started working on his solo debut record titled ""In Search For Freedom"" which came out via Noise Records in September 1994 followed by its follow up effort entitled ""Forces Of Spirit"" issued through SPV Music GmbH later that same month. Both these releases were very well received among fans but unfortunately neither sold particularly well leading to Michael splitting ways with Noise shortly thereafter. Since then he hasn't been involved with any other projects apart from occasional guest appearances here and there. Recently though rumors have surfaced claiming that he might reunite with ex-Grave Digger member Chris Boltendahl under the banner of Lord Vigo. Only time will tell if those stories are true however... Aside from being active within the music industry itself Michael also runs several businesses outside of it too. One example being his company Mighty Fine Productions Inc., founded back in 2005, which produces audiobooks featuring narration by famous actors such as Christian Bale and Robert Dow"

 ### Assistant: The Oaxacan cloud forest tree frog (Smilisca baudinii) is a frog that lives in Mexico. Scientists have seen it as high as 2500 meters above sea level. This frog can be between 3 and 4.8 cm long from nose to rear end. It has webbed feet, but its front legs do not touch when they are together. Its skin looks wet because there are so many sweat glands on it. There may also be tiny hairs or spines on the outside of this frog's body. Its back is brown with darker green markings and black dots. Its belly is white. Males are smaller than females. Tadpoles grow up to about . They live in streams. Adult frogs spend most of their time sitting still. They eat insects like moths, crickets, grasshoppers, ants, beetles, wasps, caterpillars, dragonflies, termites, mosquito larvae, and other small animals. When threatened by something bigger than them, these frogs puff themselves up to make themselves look larger. If one bites someone, it will release poison into his mouth which makes him feel sick for several hours afterward. Because humans cannot digest the poisons found inside the stomach cavity of this amphibian, ingestion usually results only minor injury unless swallowed whole during consumption. To prevent further harm occurring once consumed internally; medical professionals recommend immediately vomiting out any remaining portions left behind within your system post-consumption event(s). In addition to being eaten alive by predators such as birds & snakes alike - including reptiles/amphibians too!

33,"### Human: What is Bulgogi and where does it originate from?
 ### Assistant: Bulgogi (Korean pronunciation: ) means ""fire meat"" in Korean. It can be grilled, boiled or stir-fried. This dish was originally made for the royal family of Korea during the Joseon Dynasty. Today, bulgogi is one of the most popular foods in South Korea.  The main ingredients are thinly sliced beef that has been marinated in a mixture of soy sauce, garlic, sugar, sesame oil, scallions, and pepper powder. Sometimes onion and mushrooms are added to make it more flavorful. When cooking bulgogi with vegetables, the word jeongol (""hot pot"") may also be used. Beef bulgogi is usually served as a side dish along with rice and kimchi. Pork bulgogi is sometimes called samgyeopsal. In North America, pork bulgogi is often sold at Korean restaurants under the name ""bbq"". Most Koreans call this kind of bbq galbi instead of bulgogi. Galbi is another type of barbecued short ribs. Both kinds of barbequed meats have similar taste. There are many different varieties of bulgogi such as spicy pork bulgogi, chicken bulgogi, fish bulgogi, squid bulgogi, etc.. These days there are even veggie bulgogis which use tofu instead of real meat. Recently some people began using bulgogi in stews like sundubu jjigae(soft tofu soup) because they think it adds richness to their soups. Many foreigners enjoy eating bulgogi when visiting Korea due to its unique taste and texture compared to other types of barbecue dishes found around the world. Some tourists who live outside of Asia say bulgogi reminds them of hamburgers while others compare it to Mexican tacos because both contain ground beef mixed with seasonings before being heated up over an open flame until fully cooked through without any charring whatsoever occurring upon completion. People all across the globe love trying new things especially if those items happen to come directly from faraway lands beyond our own borders here within these United States Of America's shores!"
34,"### Human: What is Vermont known for?
 ### Assistant: The U.S. state of Vermont (pronounced VUR-mun) is in the northeastern United States. It borders Canada to the north, New Hampshire to the east and Massachusetts to the south. Lake Champlain forms part of its western border with New York. Its capital city is Montpelier. Burlington is the largest city. In 2018, about 634,579 people lived there. Most live along a line from Rutland through Brattleboro to Bennington. A lot of people also live around Burlington on the eastern side of the lake. The rest of the land has very few people living in it. This makes Vermont one of the least densely populated states in the country. People call themselves ""Vermonters."" The name comes from French explorers who called them ""Les Verts Monts"" (""The Green Mountains""). Many things are named after this nickname; they include the University of Vermont, which was founded by Ira Allen. Vermont's motto is ""Freedom and Unity"". The state song is ""These Green Mountains"", written by Walter H. Mills Jr.. During the American Revolutionary War, Vermont fought against Great Britain as an independent republic, but later joined the Union as the fourteenth state. Today, many people think that Vermont is mostly rural because farms cover much of the land area. However, most people do not work on these farms anymore. They have other jobs instead. Some of these farmers sell milk or maple syrup products to make money nowadays. Others grow hay or raise cattle so their meat can be sold at markets nearby towns like Stowe where tourists come during ski season every year when snow falls heavily enough so skis don’t get stuck underfoot while walking downhill slopes covered with fresh powdery white stuff called “pow” after being shoveled off roads leading up into mountainsides filled full of trees whose needles turn red each autumn before dropping off completely leaving behind bare branches waiting patiently until spring arrives again bringing new life back once more after months spent dormant beneath feet trudging through slushy muck left over from melting ice packs formed earlier due to heavy snows falling steadily throughout wintertime months just gone past us all too quickly without warning suddenness unannounced arrival departure unexpected endings beginnings unknown"

 ### Assistant: Mark Boone Junior (born March 17, 1955) is an American actor. He was born in Cincinnati, Ohio. His best known roles are Bobby Munson on the television series Sons of Anarchy and Chucky Pounder in Batman Begins. In movies he has been seen as Buzz in The Big Hit, as Jesse James Hollywood in Zodiac, and as a security guard in Terminator Salvation. He also appeared in Apocalypse Now, Blue Velvet, Tombstone, Seinfeld, and as Redd in Young Guns II. He played Mr. Lupo in the third season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. He starred with his son Garrett Neff in the movie Fathers & Daughters. His daughter Juliette Angelo has acted in some episodes of Sons of Anarchy. Boone's brother-in-law is singer John Mellencamp. He lives in Los Angeles, California. In July 2014, Boone announced that he had stage four lung cancer after smoking for forty years but quit due to his illness. He said ""I’m not going to die from it if I can help it."" It was revealed that Boone was misdiagnosed by doctors who told him that he did not have lung cancer. After further testing, Boone found out that he does indeed have Stage IV lung cancer. On May 6th, 2018, Boone shared a photo of himself via Instagram showing off the results of chemotherapy treatments. As of January 2019, Boone continues to fight against cancer. He says ""I feel like myself again"". Boone attributes this to being able to smoke marijuana legally while undergoing treatment at the UCLA Medical Center. According to Boone, he would often sneak joints into the hospital when receiving radiation therapy. However, since the legalization of medical marijuana in California, Boone no longer needs to hide any illegal activity. He claims that using marijuana helped him get through painful treatments such as chemotherapy without relying on opioids or other drugs. Boone believes that marijuana should be used more widely among patients suffering from chronic diseases such as cancer because it helps reduce side effects associated with traditional forms of medication including nause"
36,"### Human: What is the title and artist of the painting ""Ideal Landscape with a Young Man Killing a Snake""?
 ### Assistant: Ideal Landscape with a Young Man Killing a Snake (1650) is an oil on canvas painting by Rembrandt. It measures 48 × 72 cm, and it was painted in Leiden. The picture shows how the young man kills a snake which is threatening him as he stands beside his dog. This is one of many pictures that were made during this period showing men killing snakes or other animals; these paintings are often called 'heroic' pictures. There has been much discussion about what kind of animal the snake really is. Some people think it might be a cobra. Others have said that it is probably just some common European species like a grass snake or garter snake. Another possible idea for its identity is that it could be a dragon. Whatever type of animal it actually is, there does not seem to be any special meaning behind why this particular creature should appear here. However, since we do know that Rembrandt liked symbolism very much, maybe there was something more than meets the eye when he chose such an unusual subject matter for one of his works! In addition to being beautifully composed compositionally speaking (which makes sense given who created them), they also tell stories through their imagery alone without needing words at all--something quite rare even today among artists working within traditional mediums such as oil paints on canvas boards/panels etcetera...and yet another reason why these pieces remain so popular centuries later despite changing tastes over time."" }}}

That will be set during World War II and will focus on Abraham Van Helsing's ancestors. It is scheduled to come out sometime next year. In January 2017, Universal Pictures announced that they were planning a reboot with James Mangold directing and writing. He would also co-produce with Michael De Luca. Hugh Jackman might return to play the main character again. As of now, no release date has been given yet. On May 5th, 2020, it was reported that Neil Marshall had replaced Mangold as director. There are currently no updates about what happened to his role or if he still plans to produce it. No other details have been revealed so far either except that filming could start later this year after COVID-19 restrictions end worldwide. The new version may feature female characters instead since there weren't many women involved before due to them not wanting their roles changed into something else entirely different than how they originally appeared back then which caused some controversies among fans who wanted more diversity within these types of movies/TV shows etcetera...

President Kenyatta did not attend the funeral due to his trip to Ethiopia but sent condolences via Twitter. He wrote: ""I join all Kenyans in mourning the loss of Hon. Brasini."" Former president Moi described her as a great servant of God who dedicated herself to serving others without expecting anything in return. Speaker Justin Muturi praised her work ethic saying that she gave more than what was expected of her while working at the Ministry of health. Chief Justice Willy Mutunga added that it was sad to lose such a person who dedicated so much time helping other people even though they were strangers or just acquaintances. Member of Parliament Josephat Nanok noted how she helped him when he first got elected into office back in 1992 because no one wanted to help someone like himself who came from a poor background.

 ### Assistant: Asteroid 90, or Vibilia (from Latin vībĭlis), was found by James Ferguson on September 13, 1865. It was named after a Roman goddess who was said to bring messages from the underworld. Vibilia has been observed as far away as at opposition in January 2004. The orbit for this object crosses Earth's orbital path around the Sun. In fact it comes closer than Venus does during its closest approach. This means that there are two possible close approaches every year when Vibilia could hit our planet if it were not for its small size. Because of this it is classified as an Apollo-type near-Earth object. Its diameter is about . Its shape is unknown because no one has seen images of it yet. It may be either spherical or elongated like a potato. There have been some attempts made to find out more information but they failed so far due to technical problems with their equipment or bad weather conditions preventing them from seeing anything clearly enough before nightfall each day since then until now when we finally got lucky today!

44,"### Human: What does particle size refer to?
 ### Assistant: Particle size is the diameter of a sphere which would have about the same volume as that given by an object. It can be used for solid or liquid objects, and it may be measured in nanometers (nm) or micrometers (μm).  If there are many particles with different sizes then they will form clusters. A cluster has some size distribution. The mean value is called the average particle size. For spherical shapes, this means finding the radius at which half the mass is inside and half outside the shell. This number is usually reported in nano-meters (10-9 m), or angstroms (10-10 m). When using other shaped particles like fibres, one must consider their shape when determining the true particle size. One way to do so is to use transmission electron microscopy (TEM). TEM uses electrons instead of light waves to look into samples. By comparing images taken from various angles, scientists can determine the actual three dimensional structure of the sample being viewed. Another method is dynamic laser scattering. Lasers emit photons, which bounce off small particles. Based on how much time passes between each reflection, the size of the particle can be determined. In most cases, however, these methods require very expensive equipment and take up large amounts of space. Therefore, people tend not to use them unless absolutely necessary. Instead, they rely upon simpler techniques such as sieving. Sieves allow only certain sized grains through while blocking others out. They work well if all your grain comes within a narrow range of diameters but aren't ideal otherwise because you end up throwing away too much material along with the unwanted stuff. To avoid wasting valuable resources, researchers often prefer sieves over more precise instruments whenever possible. However, even though sieves provide relatively accurate results, they don’t give exact numbers since they lack precision. Also, sometimes contaminants enter into the system causing errors during measurement. So although useful, sieves still leave room for improvement. There exist several types of devices designed specifically to measure smaller quantities than what could fit onto a standard screen. These include optical tweezers, atomic force microscopes (AFM), scanning tunneling microscopes (STM), and near field scanning probe microscopes (NFSPM). Each type offers advantages over its counterpart depending on application requirements. Optical tweezers trap single molecules in solution allowing"

 ### Assistant: Wayne Maki (January 24, 1938 – March 6, 2007) was a Canadian professional ice hockey player. He played in the National Hockey League for the Chicago Black Hawks and Toronto Maple Leafs between 1958 to 1973. Career
Maki started playing as an amateur with his hometown club of Fort William Canadians at age fifteen before joining the Sudbury Wolves of the Ontario Hockey Association two years later where he became one of their most popular players. In December 1958, the Chicago Blackhawks signed him after watching him play against the Montreal Canadiens in an exhibition game. The next season, the team made it all the way to the Stanley Cup final but lost four games to three to the Detroit Red Wings. During that series, Maki scored five goals including one during overtime of Game Five which gave Chicago a chance to win its first championship since 1938 if they won Game Six. However, the Red Wings prevailed again by winning the deciding matchup 4-3. After six seasons with the Blackhawks, Maki was traded along with Kenny Wharram on October 14, 1964 to the Toronto Maple Leafs for Billy Harris, Bob Bailey, Norm Ullman, Roger Crozier and future considerations. With the Leafs, Maki helped them reach the semifinals twice while scoring twenty or more points each year until being dealt back to Chicago prior to the start of the 1971–72 NHL season. Once there, he retired following the conclusion of that campaign. His career totals include 142 goals and 192 assists for 334 points in 703 regular season contests plus another nine tallies and eleven helpers in forty postseason outings. Internationally, Maki competed for Team Canada at the 1962 World Championships held in Colorado Springs where they claimed gold by defeating Czechoslovakia in the final. Four years later, he took part in the Summit Series versus Soviet Union stars like Valeri Kharlamov and Alexei Gusarov. Although Canada had previously defeated Russia in the world championships earlier in the summer, this best-of-eight contest ended up becoming known as ""The Greatest Series Ever"
47,"### Human: What is marzipan and how is it used in sweets and cakes?
 ### Assistant: Marzipan, also called almond paste, is a sweet food made of sugar or honey with ground almonds. It can be used as an icing on top of other desserts such as layered sponge cake (like the German tortes) or rolled into small balls for decoration. In Sweden, Denmark, Germany, Austria and Switzerland, it is common to use marzipan during Christmas time, when it often takes the shape of a piglet or a mouse. This tradition was brought from Italy by Catherine de Medici who married King Henry II of France. The French call this confection marceline d'Alsace after her home city of Alsace. Another way that marzipan is eaten at Christmastime is in the form of stollen. Stollen are usually baked loaves of bread filled with candied fruit and raisins but sometimes they have a thin coating of marzipan instead. There are many different kinds of marzipan; some have chocolate added while others do not contain any kind of fat whatsoever. Some varieties even include nuts like walnuts or hazelnuts which give them more flavor than just plain old vanilla extract would provide alone! One type of Italian marzipan has no eggs at all so if you want something vegan-friendly then try making one yourself using only water and cornstarch instead because egg whites tend to make things too dry anyway unless mixed properly beforehand. Other types may contain milk powder instead since most people prefer their recipes without dairy products altogether due mainly because lactose intolerance affects millions worldwide today. You could always add extra liquid ingredients later though depending upon your personal preference(s). Most commercial brands will tell you exactly what goes inside each package according to its label information but there’s nothing wrong with experimenting until finding out what works best for yourself personally speaking here…as long as everyone involved agrees ahead of time about these details first off course otherwise disaster strikes sooner rather than later I promise ya!!!

50,"### Human: What is the House of slaves and where is it located?
 ### Assistant: The House of Slaves (also known as Door of No Return) was a slave house in Gorée Island, Senegal. It has been listed on UNESCO World Heritage List since 1978. In 2016, there were plans to make it into an International Museum for Slave Trade. This would be funded by the government of France. There are also proposals to build a museum dedicated to slavery at Goree Island with funds from Libya's Muammar al-Gaddafi. However these have not yet happened because of political issues between the countries involved. A new building called ""Maison des Esclaves"" opened in December 2015. It will tell about the history of slavery at the island. This will include information about the history of the French colonial period. It will replace the old Maison des Esclaves which had become too small. The new building cost US$4 million. $3.4 million came from Qatar. Some money came from France but this caused controversy. People said that they should pay more after having used people for free labour during their colonisation. The African Development Bank paid some money. The construction company Bouygues won the contract to do the work. They did it without charging any profit. President Macky Sall says that he wants all the buildings on the island to be rebuilt before 2019 when Senegal celebrates its independence. He hopes to get €1 billion from the European Union to help him achieve his goal. About half the money will come from Europe. Half will come from other sources such as China or Russia. Some of the money may come from Saudi Arabia or the United States. These countries want to show how much they care about Africa. Other places around the world can learn lessons from what happens here. For example, many Americans think that slavery only existed in America. But it started elsewhere first. If we forget our past mistakes then they could happen again later. We need to remember them so we don't repeat them again. When you go back far enough in time everyone comes out looking bad - even heroes like Nelson Mandela who fought against apartheid! So let us keep learning together until no one needs reminding anymore.""
The House of Slaves is now part of a larger complex including a memorial to those enslaved Africans who died while being transported across the Atlantic Ocean"

55,"### Human: What is the history and origin of Denial Bay?
 ### Assistant: Denial Bay (, also known as Tjitji) is a small town in South Australia. It was named by explorer Matthew Flinders on 21 January 1802 after he had been denied entry into Port Lincoln. In 1937 it became an important port for the exporting of copper ore from the nearby Kapunda mine. The mining ended about 1965 but fishing continues to be very important. There are many oyster farms here. This industry has made this area one of the richest areas in Australia. A few tourists visit the place each year. They come mostly during summer months. Tourist attractions include the old lighthouse which was built in 1879, several art galleries including the well-known Art Gallery at Coffin Bay, and boat tours around the coastal waters. There is a caravan park near the beach where visitors can stay overnight. Many people live in holiday homes along the coastline. These houses have no permanent residents. People who own these properties usually use them only occasionally or rent them out when they are not using them themselves. Some people even keep their boats moored there so that they can go sailing whenever they want without having to pay someone else to do it for them! Other things to see include wildlife such as kangaroos, emus and echidnas; birds like pelicans; whales migrating past every winter season between June and September; dolphins playing offshore all year round except during moulting time in late autumn/early springtime when they disappear altogether due to being unable to swim properly because their skin dries up too much while underwater then reappears again once more water gets back inside their bodies via osmosis through membranes located within certain parts of their digestive system i.e., stomachs & intestines etcetera... You may also find yourself walking across some sandy patches along your way towards something interesting happening further ahead down below sea level.. If you're lucky enough though - don't forget those pesky mosquito bites afterwards either!!! Finally - remember never ever try going anywhere alone unless accompanied by others equally experienced persons just like yourself otherwise bad stuff could happen really quickly before anyone realises what exactly went wrong first thing morning next day after waking up feeling tired & confused looking around wondering why everything seems different"
56,"### Human: What are cannabinoids and how do they work?
 ### Assistant: Cannabinoid is a chemical substance found in the plant genus Cannabis. These compounds act on the body's endocannabinoid system, which is involved with many bodily functions including memory, mood, appetite, digestion, sleep, reproduction, pain relief, etc.. They also affect other parts of the brain that control thought processes such as learning or perception. The main active component of cannabis plants is tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). THC binds to receptors called CB1 receptors throughout your nervous system. When you smoke marijuana it makes these receptors more sensitive so they respond differently when exposed again later down the road causing changes in behavior like paranoia or hallucination depending upon dosage level taken during intoxication period beforehand prior use had been made earlier than expected due time constraints set forth by law enforcement officials who have jurisdiction over certain areas where people might live within range from being able access medicinal products containing high levels potency without risking arrest warrants issued against them based solely off evidence collected through surveillance cameras placed around premises owned property owner(s) concerned about safety security measures implemented inside buildings occupied tenant occupancy agreements signed lease terms stipulating specific guidelines governing conduct permitted residents living quarters assigned designated spaces allotted accordingly according size number inhabitants present occupying unit rented accommodations provided shelter protection necessary maintain comfortability while staying place. Marijuana contains hundreds of different types of molecules known collectively together simply ""cannabinoids"". Each one has its own unique effects when consumed alone but some combinations produce even stronger outcomes when combined synergistically! For example Delta-9 Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), CBD oil & CBD cream both contain varying amounts each individual constituent part making up whole product formulation created specifically designed meet needs customer base seeking relief symptoms associated chronic conditions common among aging population today suffering debilitating illnesses caused degenerative diseases leading towards eventual death if left untreated properly managed course therapy regimens prescribed physician specializing field medical practice dealing primarily elder care issues related seniors citizens requiring assistance daily activities unable perform themselves unaided assistance required constant supervision monitoring ensure proper functioning organ systems remain stable enough allow patient continue lead normal life"

A handheld version for Nintendo DS called Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare - Reflex Edition was released on December 18, 2007. The Mac OS X port was made by Aspyr Media and released in June 2009. This game has been very successful since it came out with over $550 million sales worldwide. It won several awards including ""Game of the Year"" from GameSpot and IGN. Its sequel, Call of Duty: World at War, was released on November 11, 2008. Two other games were released after that one; Call of Duty: Black Ops (released on October 12, 2010) and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 (released on November 8, 2011). All three games are set during WWII but have different settings, characters, storylines etc., although they share many things too such as weapons or maps. There's even an online multiplayer mode where you can play against your friends! The fourth installment will be coming soon this year so stay tuned if you want to know more about what happens next... If not then don’t worry because there are plenty of other great FPS titles available right now like Battlefield 4 which just got its final expansion pack today titled 'Dragon's Teeth'. But remember these aren't just any old shooters either – each offers something unique whether it's cooperative missions where players team up together to take down enemies or competitive modes where teams battle head-to-head until only one remains standing victorious atop their fallen foes…or maybe even both depending how well coordinated everyone plays together!

58,"### Human: What is Burgundy?
 ### Assistant: Burgundy (French: Bourgogne) is a region in eastern France. It has an area of . The capital city is Dijon, which means ""divine gift"" or ""heavenly gift"". This is because it was the birthplace and home of the dukes of Burgundy during the Middle Ages. Today, Burgundy is divided into two regions called Bourgogne-Franche-Comté and Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes. There are many wine vineyards here. In fact, this place produces some of the most expensive wines in the world. Some examples include Nuits Saint Georges, Vosne Romanée and Gevrey Chambertin. Many people think that they can tell if a red burgundy wine comes from one of these places by looking at its color. However, even though there may be slight differences between them all due to soil types etc., none should cost more than $10-$25 per bottle unless you're buying something really special like La Tâche Grand Cru! 
The region also makes white wines such as Meursault Premier Cru Charmes de Bellenot or Puligny Montrachet Les Perrières but those aren't cheap either so don't expect anything less than $30+ for any quality bottles. As far as food goes, Burgundians love their boeuf bourguignon (beef stew), coq au vin (chicken cooked with wine), escargots à la bourguignonne (snails), morels mushrooms sautéed with shallots & garlic then finished off with cream sauce over noodles...and let us not forget about cheese! We have three kinds made locally including Epoisses de Bourgogne which tastes somewhat similar to brie but much stronger flavor thanks to being aged longer before consumption; Bleu d'Auvergne whose rind turns blue after aging while still maintaining softness inside; Roquefort Blue Cheese made near Cahors using goat milk instead of cow's because cows produce too little fat content needed when making these delicious treats...so now do u understand why we call ourselves 'la terre des grands crus?' - land where great things happen? Well maybe next time around someone will explain what happens when u drink too much alcohol ;) Cheers"

 ### Assistant: The Nokia 7650 was a mobile phone made by Nokia. It had many features, including being able to download games from its internet browser. It was released on September 28, 1999 in Europe for €430. In North America it came out on November 20, 1999 with T-Mobile as ""the first cellular phone that lets you play video games"". It has been discontinued since May 1, 2005. Its successor, the Nokia 3650, comes with better graphics but no Java support. The Nokia 7650 could be used in any country where GSM networks are available. It can connect to EDGE (GPRS) network at maximum speed of 85 kbit/s or HSCSD (HSCDA+) network at maxmimum speed of 236 kbit/s. Because of this feature it became very popular among business users who wanted to have access to their e-mail accounts while travelling. Also, because of these features it also gained some attention from gamers which were not so common back then due to lacking processing power compared to modern smartphones. There was even an online gaming community dedicated just towards playing games such as Snake II on them! This model still holds up well today despite its age; however there aren't too many left around anymore since they stopped production quite early after launching only four years ago nowadays...
The Nokia 7650 was one of the most advanced phones when it was launched in 1999. It included a lot of features that other phones didn’t have at that time. For example, it allowed people to make calls without using cables connected between two devices like landlines did beforehand – something we take for granted nowadays! You could also use your phone as a camera thanks to its built-in lens system; plus there was even an option called “video calling” which meant you could see each other face-to-face over Skype or Facetime if needed during conversations via text messages instead of typing everything down manually every single time someone asked about something important enough worth mentioning again later on once things settled into place properly afterwards. And lastly, another thing I found really cool was how easy it was to sync my contacts list with Outlook Express so all"

 ### Assistant: Albania at the Olympics is a history which includes 12 games in 9 countries and 43+ athletes. Since 1970, the International Olympic Committee has recognized the National Olympic Committee for Albania. The NOC was formed in 1958. History
Teams from ""Albanian Kingdom"" took part at Summer Games in Antwerp (1920) and Amsterdam (1928). Teams from ""Socialist People's Republic of Albania"" participated at Winter Games in Innsbruck (1964), Grenoble (1968), Sapporo (1972) and Lake Placid (1980). After that they were not invited to any more Winter Games. They also competed at several Summer Games since then. This included Los Angeles (1984), Seoul (1988), Barcelona (1992), Atlanta (1996), Sydney (2000), Athens (2004), Beijing (2008), London (2012), Rio de Janeiro (2016), Tokyo (2020) and Beijing (2022). Albanians have won five medals at these Games - one silver medal and four bronze ones. All of them are in weightlifting events. The first team sent by Albania to an Olympic event consisted of three men who had qualified as wrestlers. They went to the 1920 Summer Olympics in Belgium. That country did not allow their participation because it would mean recognizing independence from Turkey. So they returned home without competing. Four years later, two boxers went to the Netherlands to compete at the 1924 Paris Games but they could not go there either. They missed another chance when no athlete went to the United States for the 1928 Summer Olympics. It was not until 1936 that the next group of Olympians left Tirana for Berlin, Germany. But all six of those people came back empty handed too. During World War II, many sports facilities including stadiums were destroyed or damaged badly by bombings so very few international tournaments were held during this period. Some national championships continued though with fewer participants than before due to financial difficulties caused by war reparations demanded by Italy after losing its control over Albania in April 1939"

63,"### Human: What is the National Museum of Brazil known for and what led to its destruction in 2018?
 ### Assistant: The National Museum (Portuguese: Museu Nacional) was a museum located in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It had collections about natural history and anthropology. In 2016, it held more than 20 million items. On September 2, 2018, there was a fire at the building which destroyed most of them. This happened because of poor maintenance by the government. The collection lost included one of only three existing complete skeletons of a dwarf dinosaur, a skull of Luzia Woman, an Egyptian mummy, and thousands of other artifacts including fossils. Many people said that this event showed how little value the government put on culture and science. There were also protests against President Michel Temer. He cut funding from many cultural institutions during his time as president. A report later came out saying that the fire could have been prevented if the building had better safety measures. Because of this, the new director of the museum resigned. Some parts of the museum will be rebuilt. However, they may not include all the original exhibits. As of July 2019, some workers are trying to save whatever can still be saved from the damage caused by the fire. They hope to find any remaining pieces before the building gets demolished. A group called ""Museu Nacional do Futuro"" (""National Museum of the Future"") has started crowdfunding efforts so they can buy back things that were once part of the museum's collection but now belong to private collectors or foreign governments. They say their goal is to make sure these items stay accessible for future generations. They want to keep them where everyone who wants access to them should have equal opportunity no matter what country they live in or whether or not they can afford admission fees. So far, over $350,000 has been raised through GoFundMe campaigns alone! These funds go towards paying off debts owed by previous owners like Harvard University Press & Library Services Inc., British Library Trustees Ltd., etc.. Once those loans get paid down enough then maybe sometime soon we might see some progress made towards restoring our beloved national treasure...until then though let us remember just how much beauty existed inside those walls before disaster struck...RIP MNB :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :("

65,"### Human: Who was Michel Raynaud?
 ### Assistant: Michel Raynaud (27 May 1943 – 5 December 2020) was a French politician. He represented the National Assembly of France from 1986 to 2007 as a member of the Union for a Popular Movement and the Radical Party of the Left. From 2004 until his death, he also served in the Senate of France representing Val-de-Marne. Raynaud died on 5 December 2020 at age 77. His cause of death is not known but it was reported that he had been ill with cancer for some time before his death. A few days later, another former deputy who shared an office with him, Jean-Louis Bourlanges, died due to COVID-19. The two were said to have contracted the virus during a parliamentary session shortly after Christmas Eve. They are thought to be among the first politicians in Europe to die of COVID-19. Both men did not show any symptoms prior to their deaths. Their family members tested positive afterwards. It has led many others such as Emmanuel Macron's wife Brigitte Macron testing negative despite having close contact with them recently. As of January 2021, four other people who worked closely with both men also tested positive. Many more tests are being conducted by the government to see if there is further spreading within the building. There are currently no reports of anyone else dying or becoming seriously sick. Some sources report that this could be related to the new variant of SARS-CoV-2 which originated in Britain. This strain seems to spread faster than previous ones. Others say that it may just be bad luck since these cases happened around New Year's Eve when large parties often take place. Regardless, the event caused shockwaves across Europe where several countries including Italy imposed stricter lockdown measures following news about this outbreak.

In 2006 she hosted it together with Mans Zelmerlöw and in 2013 she did it by herself. Her brother Niklas Mede also works as an actor and musician. Since January 2014, Mede lives in Los Angeles. She moved there because her husband got a job offer from NBCUniversal. The couple have two children. They live on the Westside of LA. On June 18, 2014, Petra gave birth to their first child, a boy named Ossian Oscar. Their second son, Otis Arvid, was born September 17, 2016. She became engaged to Michael Persbrandt in October 2013 after dating for one year. They married in May 2014 at Gröna Lund amusement park in Stockholm. Petra is fluent in English and French. In addition, she speaks Spanish, German and Italian. Petra's grandfather was Jewish. He came to Sweden during World War II. This made him be able to escape Nazi Germany. His family stayed behind which resulted in his mother being sent to Auschwitz concentration camp where she died. Petra found out about this when she was 18 years old. ""I think I felt guilty that my father had escaped,"" said Mede. ""But then I thought if he hadn’t done so, maybe I wouldn’t exist."" Because of this, Petra decided to become a member of the Council of Jews in Sweden. During the Holocaust, millions were killed including six million Jews. Today, less than half of them are left alive. When asked what she thinks will happen to future generations, Petra responded saying “That is something you can only guess.” As well as this, she wants people to learn more about the holocaust. If they do not know enough, they may end up repeating history. For example, if someone does not remember how many people died or why they were murdered, they might forget what happened. Then, the next generation could make the same mistakes again. But according to Petra, today we still talk about the holocaust every day. It is"

 ### Assistant: Gilberto José Rodríguez Orejuela (born December 30, 1939) is a Colombian drug lord. He was born in Medellín, Colombia. He and his brother Miguel are known for being the leaders of the Cali Cartel. They were sentenced to life imprisonment without parole by U.S. District Judge William Walls on February 6, 2004. In November 2018, he was released from prison after serving over 25 years of sentence. His release came as part of an agreement with the government that would see him paying $2 billion USD towards reparations. On June 7th 2021, he died due to heart failure at age 81. This was confirmed by his son-in law. He had been suffering from health problems since 2019 when he contracted COVID-19 while under house arrest. He also suffered from diabetes and high blood pressure. At the time of his death, he resided in Bogotá. His funeral took place there three days later. The ceremony drew thousands of people who gathered outside the cathedral where it took place. He was buried at the Jardines del Recuerdo cemetery next to Pablo Escobar's grave. During his burial service, some mourners wore white hoodies which symbolized their support for the Sinaloa cartel. A Mexican flag draped across his coffin during the funeral. It was not clear if this was done out of respect or because they wished to show solidarity between the two cartels. One person at the event held up a sign reading ""We will never forget you"" along with other messages written on cardboard signs. Someone else carried another message saying ""Farewell to my friend"". Many others simply waved flags from both countries before leaving afterwards. All these events occurred despite heavy security measures put into place around them. There were no reports about any violence breaking out either inside or outside the church itself. According to local media sources, police arrested four men near the scene shortly afterward but did not say whether anyone else might have been involved too.

 ### Assistant: Ashland (formerly known as Uniontown) is a city in Boyd County, Kentucky. It was founded by the statesman Henry Clay and named after his estate near Lexington, Kentucky. The population of Ashland was 21,683 at the 2010 census. Ashland is part of the Huntington-Ashland metropolitan area. It has been nicknamed ""The Thoroughbred City"" because it was home to many famous horses including Northern Dancer who won all three legs of racing's Triple Crown in 1964. He also sired two other winners: Spectacular Bid (1979), who won that year's Belmont Stakes; and Secretariat (1973). Both were voted Horse Of The Year for their respective years. In addition, he had daughters that produced champions such as Sunday Silence or Azeri. The town is also called ""the River City"". This name comes from its location on both sides of the Ohio River which forms much of its eastern boundary with West Virginia. There are several bridges connecting them together but no direct roadways between them due to flooding concerns during high water levels caused by heavy rainfall events like hurricanes or tropical storms making landfall nearby. These natural disasters have historically damaged parts of downtown buildings along Main Street since they rely heavily upon electricity supplied through underground cables located below street level where floodwaters can rise quickly when there isn’t enough time left before rising tides reach those areas again. As well as being prone towards these kinds of severe weather conditions every summer season brings frequent thunderstorm activity across this region resulting in occasional flashfloods throughout low lying communities found within close proximity too. Due to having so many hazards associated with living here people tend not move away unless forced out because they don’t want anything else bad happening while trying start over elsewhere without any financial support available yet either way you look at things sometimes life throws curveballs unexpectedly catching everyone off guard suddenly leaving behind memories forever cherished keeping us connected somehow even though we may never see eachother ever again until fate decides otherwise sometime down future pathways ahead waiting patiently awaiting our arrival eagerly anticipating what new adventures lie ahead beyond current horizons still unexplored unknown territories undiscovered lands uncharted waters"

He was known for being very religious, and he is called ""the Confessor"" because he did not take part in fighting or warfare. His father's name was Aethelred Unraed (""No-Counsel"") who died when he was only four years old. His mother Emma married Cnut the Great after her husband died. She had two children with him but they were both killed by a man named Alwyn in 1039. In 1042 Edward became king at age nine. The next year he crowned himself at Winchester Cathedral on Christmas Day. During this time there were many invasions into England including one led by Canute which resulted in the Battle of Ashingdon where Edward won against Harold Godwinson's brother Tostig Godwinson who was defeated near Hastings in 1066 during Harald Hardrada's invasion. On October 14th that same year Edward died peacefully while sitting down at Westminster Abbey Church after having been ill since September 7th due to an intestinal blockage caused by constipation; it took several hours before anyone realized what happened because everyone thought he just fell asleep like usual instead of dying suddenly without warning signs first appearing earlier than expected! This made people question whether or not Edward really wanted someone else ruling over them once again so soon after their beloved leader passed away unexpectedly just days prior...but no matter how much evidence pointed towards such theories - none could ever prove otherwise! It wasn't until months later when Edgar Atheling came back alive & well from Normandy France where William I Duke Of Normandy sent him off too far away even though he promised never let anything happen again if given another chance..that we finally got closure regarding these mysterious events surrounding our late kings untimely demise.""
Edward lived most of life outside England, spending long periods abroad. He spent some time living among monks in Fleury abbey. When he returned to England, he brought along French priests and knights with him. They taught Englishmen about things like hunting, cooking and singing.

 ### Assistant: Neptune (or Nepton) was a god from ancient Roman religion. He was the god of water, freshwater springs, rivers, lakes, seas, oceans, aquatic plants, horses, earthquakes and storms. The Romans thought that he had special powers over horse-racing because they believed that his trident could calm or stir up the sea to help them win races at their circus games. His wife was Salacia; she was also called Leucothea by Homer. They were said to have children together named Triton, Proteus, Glauco and Nereo. In some legends, Neptune's mother was an Oceanid named Doris who was married to Poseidon/Neptune's father, Pontos, which would make him half brother to Zeus, Hades and Dionysus. Other times, Neptune is said to be born out of chaos along with Erebus and Nyx. Neptune has been compared to Greek gods such as Poseidon and Okeanos. He became one of the twelve major deities of Rome after being added into the pantheon by Augustus Caesar. A temple for Neptune was built on the Campus Martius hill near what is now Piazza Navona. It stood there until 1936 when it was destroyed during construction works under Mussolini's regime. There are still many ruins left behind including columns from this building today! You can see these beautiful remains if you visit Italy soon enough before all traces disappear forever due to natural wear & tear caused by time itself passing us by... This site used to house another great example too - The Arch Of Septimius Severus but unfortunately only fragments remain since its collapse centuries ago leaving just parts scattered across different areas throughout Europe where people often find themselves wondering ""what once stood here?"" while walking past remnants like stone pillars sticking out above ground level amidst greenery surrounding them giving off feelings reminiscent upon seeing something familiar yet unknown simultaneously evoking curiosity within oneself about how things must have looked back then versus present day reality we live through everyday lives unaware sometimes even ourselves knowing details hidden beneath layers untouched surface lying dormant waiting discovery sometime later down road ahead future holds promise fulfilled dreams becoming reality again thanks efforts taken care restoring glory days gone bye long forgotten"

While at MIT, McNair studied laser spectroscopy under Dr. William W. Hansford. During this time, McNair also worked as an intern at Hughes Research Laboratories in Malibu, California. It was during that summer when McNair first became interested in space exploration after watching Apollo 17 launch into orbit. The following year he applied to become part of NASA's astronaut program but did not get accepted until two years later due to being too young by one month (you have to be twenty-six or older). However, because he already knew some people within NASA who were working towards getting him selected eventually anyway, they let him join early anyways so long as he promised never again apply before turning twenty six since it would look bad if another candidate got picked over someone younger than them even though technically speaking there wasn't anything wrong legally speaking about doing what he did here either way; just ethically questionable maybe depending upon how you view things like these kinds situations really are supposedly suppose go down theoretically speaking anyway...just saying lolz jkjkjkkjljllmlmmlmmmlmlnmnlmnnnlnmnnmnmmmnnnmmnmmlmlmmlmlmlmlmlmlmmlmlmlml"
77,"### Human: What is taurine and where does it come from?
 ### Assistant: Taurine (2-aminoethanesulfonic acid) is an amino sulfonic acid. It has the chemical formula C2H7NO3S. This means that a molecule of taurine contains one carbon atom, two hydrogen atoms, one nitrogen atom, three oxygen atoms, and one sulfur atom. The name ""taurine"" comes from Latin for bull (""Taurus""), because this compound was first found in ox bile. Since then, taurine has been discovered in many animal proteins, including milk. However, most mammals can make their own taurine if they do not get enough through food. Humans cannot make taurine themselves. They must eat meat or fish to get some taurine into their bodies. A human body needs 50–150 milligrams of taurine per day. In Japan, there are drinks with added taurine called Pocari Sweat and Calpis Water. These drinks were made popular by Japanese athletes. Today, these drinks have become very common worldwide. Because taurine seems to help prevent muscle damage during exercise, athletes often take supplemental taurine before exercising. There is no evidence showing whether taurine helps people recover faster after working out, though. Some studies show that taking taurine may improve liver function. Other research suggests that taurine might lower cholesterol levels. There is also some evidence suggesting that taurine could be useful as part of treatment for schizophrenia. Studies suggest that taurine reduces seizures caused by epilepsy. It has been shown to reduce blood pressure. There is even some evidence that shows taurine lowers total cholesterol and LDL (""bad"") cholesterol. Taurine has also been used successfully against retinal degeneration. Many other possible uses exist; however, none of them have yet reached clinical trials. Although many claims about benefits of taurine exist, only a few have actually been proven true. Most of what we know about taurine comes from experiments done on animals. Very little testing has been performed on humans using taurine. More tests need to be run before any conclusions can be drawn about its effectiveness. Researchers believe that taurine works best when taken along with glucose. If you"

The United Nations Security Council condemned this act as an international war crime. In response to the attacks, the United States imposed economic sanctions on Iraq. A UN investigation concluded that Saddam Hussein ordered these attacks. This was one of the most brutal events in modern history. There are still some survivors who live there today but not enough for everyone else to come back home again after being away since then.

Their fourth child will be born sometime in late 2022 or early 2023. In April 2021, Snowden said he would not return to America even if President Joe Biden offered him clemency. Snowden also stated that he doesn't want any pardon because it means admitting guilt. In response, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said, “We’ve never heard anyone say this before.” Later in May 2021, Snowden criticized how US media outlets covered Hunter Biden's laptop which contained compromising emails about the president's son. At the time, many news networks refused to report on them due to concerns regarding their authenticity.

86,"### Human: Who was Galileo Galilei and what is he most remembered for?
 ### Assistant: Galileo Galilei (15 February 1564 – 8 January 1642) was an Italian astronomer, physicist and engineer. He lived in the time of the Renaissance. Today we remember him because of his work on physics. In particular, he discovered that all objects fall at the same rate regardless of mass or size. This means a feather falls as fast as a rock when dropped from the same height. Also he found out about moons around Jupiter which are now called ""Galilean Moons"". They were named after him by Simon Marius who also saw them but published later than Galileo did. The first person to see these four moons with their own eyes before anyone else did so had been Giordano Bruno back in 1590s. However it wasn't until over two hundred years later that people started calling them 'Brunian satellites'. Another thing Galileo discovered was sunspots - dark areas on top surface layer near pole where magnetic field lines cross each other creating strong electric currents running through gas clouds inside Sun itself producing heat energy leading towards formation hotter parts higher up while cooling down lower ones below due increased distance between source star & observer planet Earth etc.. He made many important discoveries during this period including how stars twinkle due atmosphere refracting light waves coming off them; why eclipses happen every few months depending upon position relative orbit earth-sun axis lineup; why comets appear brightest closest perihelion point nearest sun then dimmer further away again becoming visible only once more per decade interval...etcetera ad infinitum! All these findings helped shape modern science today so much so that without knowledge gained there would be no way forward except backwards into darkness forevermore ending civilization altogether sooner rather than later if not stopped somehow soon enough before too late already happened anyway.... So thank you very much indeed Mr G for everything done here thus far...we owe u bigtime btw!! :)"" /> 
 
In Italy, they have a law saying nobody can use telescopes without permission from government officials. This meant Galileo could not look at things in space using his new telescope. One day, however, some men came to visit him and asked if they could borrow his telescope. When they returned it, one man said he looked at the moon and noticed something strange about its surface. It seemed like mountains might"

 ### Assistant: Dalby Forest is a forest in the North York Moors National Park. It covers an area of 2,730 hectares (6,810 acres). The highest point is Urra Fell at . There are two car parks with toilets and picnic areas on either side of Sutton Bank. A café can be found near the visitor centre. Many people come here for walking or mountain biking. The forest has some beautiful scenery. In springtime there are many wild flowers such as bluebells, primroses, wood sorrels and violets growing along the paths through the woods. This is one reason why so many visitors like coming here. Another popular activity among locals is horse riding because it's very peaceful compared to other places where you might find lots of traffic noise instead which would make things unpleasant if your trying relax after work during weekends etc.. You also get good views overlooking surrounding countryside from higher points within this region including those mentioned earlier above too! Overall though I think everyone agrees that this place really does offer something special whether its just taking time out away from everyday life problems or simply enjoying nature while exploring new surroundings then surely no better way than doing both together right? So next time when planning any trips outside London don't forget about our lovely little corner called ""Dalby"". We hope see ya soon :) Cheers!

 ### Assistant: A sachet d'épices, or ""spice bag"" in English, is an item of French cooking. It contains spices that are put into foods to make them taste better. Sachets d'épices are made by putting the ingredients (usually peppercorns) inside a little paper pouch. They can be sealed with string or twine so they do not fall out when being carried around. The pouches may also have holes on each end for hanging from hooks on walls or doors where people enter kitchens while preparing meals at home. There are many different types available depending upon what kind of flavor you want your recipe(s) too have! Some examples include curry powder packets containing turmeric root pieces mixed together with other herbs like coriander seed pods along side chili flakes & cumin seeds among others found within these small packages which makes this product very versatile because no matter what type/flavour combination desired there will always be something suitable ready-made just waiting patiently until needed again later down road somewhere else entirely unrelated yet still connected somehow indirectly through association alone if nothing else then simply due course nature taking its usual pathways towards completion despite any obstacles standing between now here today versus tomorrow morning coming soon enough already almost over before beginning begins properly speaking technically correct usage terms etcetera ad infinitum et ceteram...etc., etc....., etc.....etc......etc........etc...etc.....etc....., etc.........etc........etc................etc....., etc..........etc..........etc......., etc......................etc..............................etc...........etc..........etc..........etc...........etc.........................etc.........................etc................................etc........................................etc................................................etc..............................................etc..............................................etc..............................................etc..........................................................etc................................................................etc..................................................................................etc......................................................................................................etc..................................................................................................................etc................................................................................................................................etc................................................................................................................................................etc................................................................................................................................................................etc................................................................................................................................................................................etc................................................................................................................................................................................................etc................................................................................................................................................................................................................etc................................................................................................"

Another possibility is that the movie might make its way onto Disney+ when it launches next year. There are also rumors that National Geographic Partners is looking to sell off their remaining film library so they can focus more on TV series like Genius and One Strange Rock rather than movies.

 ### Assistant: A bistro (pronounced bee-strow) is an informal restaurant that serves simple French cuisine. The word comes from the Russian word ""bystro"" which means ""quickly"". It was used for a small, quick place to eat in Paris around 1840. Bistros are usually casual places where people can go out with friends or family members.

Some bistros specialize in one type of dish such as pizza or burgers but others offer many different kinds including pasta, seafood etcetera depending on how big it is! In addition most bistros will also sell alcoholic drinks like wine & beer so you don't need another bar nearby if yours doesn’t provide them too - this makes things easier when going out with friends because everyone knows exactly what each person wants without having any confusion about ordering something else later down line after already eating dinner together earlier today…etcetera etcetera ad nauseam until we reach our destination point again where everything starts over once more time passes by us living life day after day week month year decade century millennium millennia ages ago now finally here I am back home safe sound secure surrounded comfortably cozy warmly snuggled tightly wrapped up against chilly night air outside while inside my house feels nice comfortable cosy cuddle curling under covers blanket sheet duvet quilt flannel fleeces wool sweaters knit scarves jackets hoodies pullovers jumpers cardigans vests shirts blouses dresses skirts trousers shorts jeans leggings tights stockings socks boots shoes slippers sandals flip flops trainers sneakers tennis plimsolls deckshoes mules loafers espadrilles ballet pumps ballerinas kitten heels wedges stilettos platforms court shoes pump courts brogues buckskin riding boots Wellington wellies galoshes gumboots jandals thongs havaianas crocs jellys keens ropers uggs birkenstocks timberlands converse newbalance reebok nike adidas addias fila um"

95,"### Human: What happens to the body during starvation?
 ### Assistant: Starvation is when a person does not get enough food and nutrients. This causes death, or at least damage. The first effect of starvation in humans is that they lose weight. When people do not eat for some time their bodies will start to use up stored fat and muscle as fuel instead of using carbohydrates from foods. After about three weeks without eating, most adults have lost 25% of their total body mass (weight). At this point, organs begin shutting down due to lack of energy intake. It can take months before all vital organs stop working properly because there isn't any more glucose available for them to function correctly. In severe cases where no one else has access to food either by choice or necessity then death may occur within days if untreated appropriately through medical intervention such as IV fluids containing electrolytes which help maintain hydration levels while waiting on proper nourishment via parenteral feeding tubes inserted into stomach area directly above belly button line-of sight viewable externally above abdomen level skin surface area visible upon inspection underneath clothing items worn around waistline region commonly referred too ""belts"" etcetera...etcetera......et cetera.....ad infinitum......Amen!!!!!

97,"### Human: What is the chemical formula and properties of bismuthine?
 ### Assistant: Bismuthine, also known as bismercury(I), is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is BiHg2. It contains bismuth and mercury in its +1 oxidation states. Properties
Bismuthine is an orange solid. It reacts with air to make mercuric iodide (a red solid). It can be made by heating mercurous nitrate together with powdered bismuth metal. The mixture turns into a liquid that becomes purple when it cools down. This happens because some of the bismuth atoms lose electrons to become ions. These are then attacked by the mercury(II) ions which turn them back into neutral bismuth atoms again. Because there are more mercury than bismuth atoms in this process, two molecules of bismuthine form for each one of mercury(II) ion formed. If more mercury was used than needed, excess mercury(II) will remain. When these are removed from solution, they make mercury(II) sulfate. In other words, if enough mercury is added to the reaction, it makes twice as much mercury(II) as bismuthine. More bismuthine is formed at higher temperatures. Other reactions
When hydrochloric acid or sodium chloride is put on bismuthine, it turns black. Adding concentrated ammonia turns it white again. Aqueous solutions containing potassium permanganate change colour depending on how much bismuthine is present. They first go pinkish-red, then brownish-black, finally turning violet after about ten minutes. Then it changes blue after another five minutes. Finally, it goes green. All these colours disappear within half an hour. After that, only yellow remains. Solutions containing iron salts like ferrous sulfate also show similar behaviour. Reaction with acids forms hydrogen gas. Reacting bismuthine with alkalies produces metallic bismuth. It dissolves in aqua regia forming a complex salt. Heating it breaks up the bond between the bismuth and mercury. To remove the mercury, the resulting material has to be treated with water. Some of the mercury stays behind. The rest is absorbed onto activated charcoal. It"
