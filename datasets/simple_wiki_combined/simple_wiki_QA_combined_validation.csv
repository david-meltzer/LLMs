This is written as 1‰.  Fresh water contains less than 0.1% of salt . This is the usual case for rivers and lakes.
 Brackish water contains between 0.1% and 3% of salt. This environment is usually found at estuaries where a river flows into the sea. 
 Saline water contains between 3% and 5% of salt (per volume). Usually, there is about 3.5% salt in the water of the oceans.
 Water that has more than 5% salt in it, is called brine. Some lakes and bodies of water have that much salt in them. The Dead Sea has about 15% salt (150‰) on the surface."

A Structural pipe fitting, also known as a slip on pipe fitting, clamp or pipe clamp is used to build structures such as handrails, guardrails, and other types of pipe or tubular structure. They can also be used to build furniture and theatrical riggings. The fittings slip on the pipe and are usually locked down with a set screw. The set screw can then be tightened with a simple hex wench. Because of the modular design of standard fittings, assembly is easy, only simple hand tools are required, and risks from welding a structure are eliminated.
Other advantages of using structural pipe fittings are easy installation and reconfigurable design. Since there are no permanent welds in the structure, the set screws of the fittings can simply be loosened, allowing them to be repositioned. The project can be disassembled and stored if needed, or even taken apart with fittings and pipe recycled into a new project.
Fittings used for strong structures are galvanised malleable iron castings, and come in many styles such as elbows, tees, crosses, reducers and flanges. The fittings are not threaded; they simply lock onto the pipe with the supplied hex set screws."

The first reason is that the method of dating that is most widely used around the world today, the Gregorian calendar, was introduced into English cultures only in 1752. The second is that 1 January has not always been the first day of the year. In the British Empire (and some other countries), March 25th was the start of the year. Both of these conventions changed not very long ago, in historic terms, as just a few centuries ago. So when a date is given in a history book (or an old book), we need to know whether it is in the modern New Style or the traditional Old Style. During the time of the changeover, people would give both dates. Even today, when historians are writing about an event in those times, they often give the date as it was used at the time but also give the modern equivalent for your convenience."

It has 4 reactors, which each generate 915 MW, for a total of 3.6 TW. It is next to the highway, about halfway between Valence-sur-Rhône and Avignon. It is on the River Rhône. It was built form 1974 to 1981; the first reactors started working in 1980. It has been criticized several times, because of incidents:
The French control authority said in 2002 that certain means of cooling would not work when there was an earthquake.
A study done in 2004 said that tests done at the site showed that firefighters needed 37 minutes to bring a fire under control. This is too long, and mostly related to the lack of training. According to the report, this makes it impossible to extinguish a bigger fire.
In 2003, the temperature of the water of the canal next to the site was higher than allowed, for a total of over 44 hours. The autorized limit was 27 °C, the measured temperature was 28.8 °C.
Between July 7 and July 8, 2008, a solution containing Uranium was spilled on the site; about 75 kg of a total of about 250 kg reached nearby rivers., during cleaning works. The incident has been classified at level 1 of 8 of the International Nuclear Event Scale. The company doing the uranium enrichment was closed. French authorities have banned the use of water from the respective rivers for drinking and watering of crops. Swimming, water sports and fishing were also banned. Measurements done 3 days later on the site revealed radiation levels that could not be explained by the facts cited, alone. The leader of the investigation team said that there probably had been similar incidents earlier that were not reported. 
In July 2008, about 100 employees were exposed to radioactive particles that escaped from a pipe in a reactor that had been shut down.
On August 21, 2008 workers replacing a drain pipe detected a broken valve. Because of this, radioactive uranium would occasionally spill into the sourrounding environment. A study is currently under way to determine how much uranium escaped, those running the power plant talk of about 250g per year."

As in the pipe organ, the sound is made by air blowing through the pipes, but power to make the air blow does not come from bellows or from electricity as in the modern organ, but from water, for example from a waterfall. A hydraulis is an early type of pipe organ that was powered by water. It was invented in the 3rd century B.C., probably by the Hellenistic scientist Ctesibius of Alexandria. It was the world's first keyboard instrument. Many centuries later it developed into the modern pipe organ."

This was common for more than 4000 years. The Romans and Carthaginians also sometimes did this. The elephant would step upon the head of the condemned, the one commanded to die. Usually, handlers trained the elephant to put its large foot gently on the person's head. At this point, witnesses looked under the elephant's foot to make sure the prisoner was the one who committed the crime. Often, the condemned would scream and beg the witnesses to say it was not him. If a witness stated this was not the criminal, they would probably commit perjury. Perjury means lying at a trial. In those days rulers could punish perjury with death. Few witnesses denied the condemned was the criminal, because then the elephant may crush them instead. Then the mahout, or elephant driver, gave the order, and the elephant would push down with its weight. The skull broke and the foot crushed the head flat."

It serves as a typical example or standard for things of the same category. Some prototypes are used to find defects or to test an idea. Prototypes are built for different reasons:
Proof of principle prototype (or model): Shows that something can be done. These kinds of prototypes are built to test a part of the design. These prototypes do not look like the finished product, in most cases. Such prototypes are used to show that certain design choices will work or will not work.
Form-study prototype (model): This tries to show what the finished design will look like, but without the function. Such prototypes allow to take decisions about the exact shape, size, or ergonomic properties. This lets a designer see if things fit together, and will feel right.
Visual prototype: These will look like the actual product, and are used for market research. They do not have any of the functionality of the final product. An example is a concept car at a car show. It may look like a new car but may not even have an engine.
Functional prototype: These will behave and act like the final product as much as possible. For cost reasons, they may be smaller in size, or they may not have the final look of the product."

So there are places in the northern valley with tall bluffs, places where the river water cut some of the rock away. People can see the layers in the bluffs. Some of them are 400 feet tall.

The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board said a problem with the design probably caused the bridge to fall. They said a too-thin steel plate ripped along a line of rivets. Also, additional weight at the time due to ongoing rehabilitation construction led to the major failure that caused the bridge to fall into the Mississippi River.
