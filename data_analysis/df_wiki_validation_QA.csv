It is the largest navy in the world, with the estimated tonnage of its active battle fleet alone exceeding the next 13 navies combined, including 11 U.S. allies or partner nations. It has the highest combined battle fleet tonnage, and the world's largest aircraft carrier fleet, with eleven in service, two new carriers under construction, and five other carriers planned. With 336,978 personnel on active duty and 101,583 in the Ready Reserve, the U.S. Navy is the third largest of the U.S. military service branches in terms of personnel. It has 290 deployable combat vessels and more than 3,700 operational aircraft . History The navy was called the Continental Navy from 1775 until Congress disbanded it and sold the ships in 1785. It was started again as the Department of the Navy on April 30, 1798. The Department of the Navy needed places to make ships, which are called shipyards. So it paid slaveowners to borrow their slaves, then forced the slaves to build and run the shipyards in Washington, D.C., Norfolk, Virginia, and Pensacola, Florida. Sailors Today, the US Navy has over 300,000 sailors and officers, and almost another 100,000 workers who are not official sailors. Strength The US Navy has about 300 warships, or ships designed for fighting. The largest warships are aircraft carriers, which have large and flat decks that act as small airports for planes carrying weapons.

This is done by sending out sound waves, and measuring how long it takes for the echo of the sound to come back. The speed of sound in the water is known, so the depth can be calculated. It is a kind of sonar. Note that the word sounding is used for all kinds of technologies, even though some do not use sound. Before echo sounding was used (in the early 20th century), sounding lines were lowered into the water to measure the depth. The sound reflects off the seafloor and returns to the transducer. The time the sound takes to travel to the bottom and back is used to calculate the distance to the seafloor. Water depth is estimated by using the speed of sound through the water (approximately 1,500 meters per second). The product is divided by two because the measured time is the round-trip time (from the transducer to the seafloor and back to the transducer). The faster the sound pulses return to the transducer from the ocean floor, the shallower the water depth is and the higher the elevation of the sea floor. The sound pulses are sent out regularly as the ship moves along the surface, which produces a line showing the depth of the ocean beneath the ship. This continuous depth data is used to create bathymetry maps of the survey area."

The common people liked spectacular effects and beautiful stage sets became very important. The use of stage machinery also became important. The entertainment was open to everyone. It was free of charge. The Western Roman Empire declined during the 4th century. Christianity had become the official religion. An official edict closed the theatre in AD 391.

In a corps sponsored by the Royal Regiment of Canadian Artillery, the rank of Master Corporal (MCpl) is called Master Bombardier (MBdr), and the rank of Corporal is called Bombardier (Bdr) instead of the usual names. In the guards regiments, Warrant Officers (WO) are known as Colour Sergeants (CSgt), and Second Lieutenants are known as Ensigns. A cadet cannot hold the rank of Second Lieutenant, as it is an officer rank. Medals and awards Canadian Cadets who perform very well in their duties as a cadet can be given medals and awards, which are worn on their uniform. The medals are similar in style to the medals given to CAF service members. Cadets may be awarded medals if they show bravery, citizenship, cadet service, exemplary service during a summer training course, and more. Cadets may also wear any orders, decorations, or medals of Canada that they have received."

If the quality of a product is high then that means that it is fit for its purpose. If the quality of an item is low that means that the product may break easily or not work properly. When people say something is a quality product that means that the product is of good quality. Usually higher-quality products cost more money, because the materials used to make them are better, or the way they were made was more effective. In other words, things that are low quality are cheap. Quality is understood differently by different people, depending on what they consider quality to be. Generally, though, it is how well a product is suited to the purpose it was made for."

The river runs through southwest London. Rain falls on the North Downs, filters through the chalk and emerges on the spring line. The river is first visible at Wandle Park in Croydon. It passes through the London Boroughs of Croydon, Sutton, Merton, and Wandsworth to join the River Thames at Wandsworth. The River Wandle is between 9 and 11 miles long. History of the River Wandle The river has been used since Roman times. It was heavily industrialised in the 17th and 18th centuries and was one of the most polluted rivers in England. In Victorian times the Wandle was one of hardest working rivers in the world. The river was used to power 68 water wheels, of which only a few survive, such as at Merton Abbey Mills. On 17 September 2007, a chemical was accidentally flushed into the Wandle from Thames Water's Beddington sewage works. The chemical was being used to clean, but instead of being put back through the treatment works, it was accidentally put into the river. This resulted in over 2,000 fish of various species being killed. The company failed to tell the Environment Agency of the incident, as the site manager thought it wasn't important. Dry fly fishing was first started for catching trout from the river. Cleanups of the Wandle have improved the water quality, leading to a return of the river's once famous brown trout. This improvement in water quality has also seen other fish thrive. There are stocks of chub, roach and perch all flourishing once again with the most popular angling spots situated on the river at Colliers Wood. Also found in the River Wandle are water voles, otters, the common toad, and grey heron. Water voles usually live along rivers."

It shows the relation between stars' luminosity (that is, how bright they are) and their temperature (how hot they are). These diagrams are not pictures or maps of the locations of the stars. Rather, Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams plot each star on a graph measuring the star's brightness versus its temperature. Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams are also called H-R diagrams or HRDs. You can see an example of a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram to the right. This diagram is based on measurements from 23,000 stars in our Milky Way galaxy. The Hertzsprung-Russell diagram is named after its creators, astronomers Ejnar Hertzsprung and Henry Norris Russell. Drawing a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram The vertical axis of a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram shows the luminosity or brightness of the stars, as if they were all measured from the same distance. Another term for this is absolute magnitude. The brighter a star is, the higher its plot will be on this chart. The horizontal axis shows the surface temperature of the stars. However, the temperatures go down, not up, as you move to the right. That is, the left of the diagram contains stars with the highest temperature plots (greater than 30,000 Kelvins) while the right shows stars with temperatures of only 3000K. In general, the temperature of a star relates to its color. At the top of the chart, along with the temperatures, are the Spectral Classes. The hottest stars are blue-white (class O), those in the middle temperatures are yellow (class G) and the coolest ones are red (class M). (Of course, when we say ""coolest"" about stars, we must realize that the lowest temperature for a star is almost 5000 degrees Fahrenheit."

Course The source of the White River is in the Boston Mountains of northwest Arkansas, in the Ozark–St. Francis National Forest southeast of Fayetteville. The river flows northwards from its source in northwest Arkansas. It loops up through southwest Missouri into Table Rock Lake at Branson, Missouri. In Branson the river enters Lake Taneycomo, controlled by the Powersite Dam. The Powersite was the first dam on the White River. The flow continues downstream into Bull Shoals Lake. From there it travels back into Arkansas, and then heads generally southeast to where it flows into the Mississippi River. Despite being much shorter than the Arkansas River, it carries nearly as much water—normally more than , and occasionally more than during floods. River modifications Lake Taneycomo was created in 1913 when the Empire District Electric Company built a dam just south of Forsyth, Missouri. Beaver Lake, Table Rock Lake, and Bull Shoals Lake are man-made lakes or reservoirs created by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. This was under the authority of the Flood Control Act of 1938. A total of eight dams restrict the upper White River. Six are in Arkansas and two in Missouri. The White River National Wildlife Refuge lies along the lower part of the river.

The White River was once known as one of the best Smallmouth bass fisheries in the world.

The main town of Somerset was Somerton, but it is now Taunton. There are two cities in Somerset. They are Bath and Wells. History The name ""Somerset"" comes from the Anglo-Saxon phrase Sumorsaete, which was used to describe people from Somerton. In the past, the northern border of Somerset was the River Avon. However, as the city of Bristol has grown, the border moved south. In 1974 parts of north Somerset, the city of Bristol and parts of south Gloucestershire were joined into a new county. This county was named Avon. In 1996 Avon was split into 4 parts, which are now unitary authorities. People usually say that 2 of these parts (named North Somerset and Bath and North East Somerset) are part of Somerset, even though they have their own councils. The oldest prison in England which is still used is in a town named Shepton Mallet in Somerset. Somerset also has the world's oldest road which people built. It is called the Sweet Track; it was built in about 3800 BC. Industry and tourism There is not much large industry in Somerset, but Bridgwater is a port, and Yeovil is important in building helicopters. Tourism is an important industry in the county; in 2001 about 23,000 people worked in tourism. Tourists like Somerset because it is very beautiful, with much countryside and few big towns. Somerset has many places to visit: Part of the Exmoor National Park is in Somerset. Another popular place is Glastonbury, which has a popular music festival every year. The Cheddar Gorge has caves which are popular with visitors, and locally made cheese. Farming is an important industry in Somerset, but not as many people work in this industry today."

The development is strongly influenced by genetic, mental, physical and social factors that may happen during the progression. Children develop at different levels. In particular, children having autism spectrum troubles or Down syndrome may have different development than usual or substandard motor development. Ideas about how children develop psychologically have changed over time. There are several important theories on how children develop. Early ideas In medieval times During this time children were seen as separate than adults. Children under 7 or 8 were different than other people and treated as children. Even teenagers were not fully grown. Religious writings sometimes talked about children as evil and needing to be pure. They also sometimes talked about them as good and angels. During the Reformation At the time of the Reformation, children were thought to be born evil. Adults thought children needed to be taught to be a person. Children had to wear tight and uncomfortable clothes. Raising a child was thought to be one of the most important things. Adults wanted children to use reason in learning. Age of Enlightenment In the time of the Enlightenment, people started to think differently about children and development. People respected children more and treated them better. Two important people had ideas about children during the Enlightenment. They were John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau. John Locke John Locke thought that children were born without any knowledge. He thought the mind is tabula rasa, or blank slate. This means that the mind is like a blank piece of paper when someone is born. Children get knowledge in life and fill up the blank paper."

The planet's southernmost active volcano, Erebus (3794 m), as well as the dormant volcano Terror (3230 m), are situated on the island.

Discovery The island was discovered by Sir James Clark Ross in 1841, and it was later named in his honour by Robert F. Scott. Ross Island was the base for many of the early expeditions to Antarctica. It was and still is the southernmost island reachable by sea. Huts built by Scott's and Shackleton's expeditions are still located on the island, preserved as historical sites.

Joseph Proust, a French chemist, first observed it in 1794. For this reason, it is sometimes called Proust's law. Amounting to the same thing is the law of constant composition. This states that all samples of a given chemical compound have the same elemental composition by mass. For example, oxygen makes up about 8/9 of the mass of any sample of pure water, while hydrogen makes up the remaining 1/9 of the mass. The law of definite proportions is the basis of stoichiometry, together with the law of multiple proportions.

Oceanic crust is primarily composed of mafic rocks, or sima which is named for its magnesium silicate minerals. It is thinner than continental crust, and is about 7-10 kilometers thick, however it is more dense, having a mean density of about 3.3 g/cm3. Oceanic crust generally does not last longer than 200 million years. In the rock cycle, it is continuously created at oceanic ridges. At these ridges, hot magma rises into the crust and cools, pushing the crust apart at the ridge. The continuous formation of new oceanic crust pushes the older crust away from the mid-ocean ridge. As it moves away from the ridge, the crust becomes cooler and denser, while the sediment may build on top of it."

This was the instrument on which he learned to play. It was some time before he started proper lessons, but by the time he was a teenager he was playing the organ for church services. When he was 15 he went to Bayreuth to hear Wagner’s operas. This was the moment when Reger decided he wanted to become a musician. Reger studied music in Munich and Wiesbaden with a famous teacher Hugo Riemann. He composed a lot of music, especially for the organ. His musical style was similar to that of Brahms, but he also learned a lot from the music of Bach, Mendelssohn and Schumann. He liked the symphonic poems of Liszt and these gave him the ideas for writing chorale fantasies for the organ, although he never wrote music that tells a story (programme music).

History In 1866, a group of 35 artists founded the Chicago Academy of Design in a studio on Dearborn Street. The group wanted to run a free school with its own art gallery. The organization was modeled after European art academies, such as the Royal Academy. People who worked there were called Academians and Associate Academians. The Academy's charter was granted in March 1867. Classes started in 1868. Classes met every day. Students paid the school US$10 per month. The new Academy was a success. The school next built a five story stone building at 66 West Adams Street, which opened on November 22, 1870. When the Great Chicago Fire destroyed the building in 1871, the Academy began to owe a lot of money. The Academy tried and failed by renting facilities. By 1878, the Academy owed $10,000. Members tried to rescue the weak institution by making deals with local businesses. Some people gave up in 1879 and started a new new organization, named the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts.

Such snakes are not venomous. its family is the Pythonidae. Pythons are more closely related to boas than to any other snake family. Boulenger (1890) thought this group was a subfamily (Pythoninae) of the family Boidae (boas). However, boas produce live young, while pythons are oviparous: they lay eggs. Python can be found in Southeast Asia and Africa, and other members of the family are found in New Guinea and Australia. Pythons can range from 3 feet long in species like ball pythons to 29 feet in species like reticulated pythons. Python is one of eight genera in the family. They all have a rather similar life style. Most members of the family are ambush predators: they stay motionless in a camouflaged position, and then strike suddenly at passing prey. They wrap their body round the prey and squeeze. To kill its prey, the python squeezes it to death, then swallows it whole. Larger pythons can prey on animals as large as a full-grown deer. In Africa, there are pythons that eat gazelles. Most of their prey is much smaller than that. Pythons may take several days or even weeks to fully digest prey. Despite their size, pythons are rarely dangerous to humans. Python can be up to 900 cm long and weigh up to 90 kg, but males are much smaller and lighter than females. The python can live up to 30 years. The breeding time is between 60 or 70 days. Research indicates that all snakes, including pythonids, are descended from a venomous ancestor. Pythons in unusual places Burmese pythons have become an invasive species in south Florida.

Miranda asked why he was being arrested but was given no answer. At the time of his arrest he was not charged with any crime. Ten days earlier an 18-year old girl claimed she had been sexually assaulted. When she talked to the police, her story changed several times. A few days later she was leaving work and saw a suspicious car she thought might be the same as the one used in her assault. A partial license plate led police to arrest and question Miranda.

It began 174.1 million years ago, and ended at 163.5 million years ago. In the Middle Jurassic, Pangaea began to split apart. It began to separate into Laurasia and Gondwana, and the Atlantic Ocean formed. Tectonic activities closed the Paleo-Tethys Ocean. A subduction zone on the coast of western North America continues to create the ancestral Rocky Mountains. Life of the epoch Marine life During this time, marine life (including ammonites and bivalves) flourished. Ichthyosaurs, although common, are reduced in diversity. A type of crocodilians first appeared. Plesiosaurs became common at this time. The top marine predators, the pliosaurs, grew to the size of killer whales and larger e.g. Pliosaurus, Liopleurodon. Terrestrial life New types of dinosaurs evolved on land. Cetiosaurus was an early sauropod found in England in the mid-19th century. The environment in which Cetiosaurus lived was floodplain and open woodland. Brachiosaurs and Megalosaurus also lived in this environment. The cynodont therapsids flourished with the dinosaurs, but they were only shrew-sized. None grew larger than a badger. One group of cynodonts, the Trithelodonts were becoming rare and eventually became extinct at the end of this epoch. The Tritylodonts were still common, though. In this epoch ""true"" mammals evolved from a group of cynodonts. Flora Conifers were dominant in the Middle Jurassic. Other plants, such as ginkgoes, cycads, and ferns were also common.

It is very similar to FromSoftware's other games, the Souls series. The game has many similar features from the Souls series. Below are the similarities. Both games have a high level of difficulty that cannot be changed. Enemies and bosses can kill the player in only a few hits. Experience points are earned by killing enemies, dropped if the player dies, and disappear forever if the player dies again before getting them back. Upgradeable weapons and armor can be found in the game world or be bought using experience points. Rolling is important for dodging enemy attacks. While the game has many similarities with the Souls series, there are also some big differences as well. Below are the differences. The games have a different setting. Bloodborne takes place in an dark Industrial Revolution-like world rather then a Medieval Europe-like one, such as one of the Souls series. Bloodborne has a faster pace, where the player can move and attack more quickly. The player does not have shields, the player cannot block or parry enemy attacks. The player can use guns in their offhand for stunning enemies and attacking them from far away.

Her birth name was Priscilla Maria Veronica White and she was born in Liverpool. She became known for her songs ""Anyone Who Had A Heart"" and ""You're My World"" as well as her long-running TV shows Blind Date (1985-2003) and Surprise Surprise (1984-2001). In the early 1960s, young Cilla worked at the Cavern Club in Liverpool, where the Beatles often performed, as a hat check girl. She also sang onstage at the Cavern sometimes, backed by the band that was playing at the time. ""Swinging Cilla"" was well-liked by the Cavern's members and guests. One day Brian Epstein visited the Cavern to meet the Beatles, and ask about a record they made, so he could sell copies at his family's music store. Stories rose later that Cilla was working, and she first met Epstein when he gave her his hat and coat. Neither one remembered this later, though, and each believed the story was not true. Epstein's getting to know the Beatles led to his becoming their manager, and with his help, they won a recording contract. The Beatles' talent and work with music producer George Martin led to hit records. Epstein decided to manage other Liverpool musicians. Along with the bands and male singers he signed up, Epstein chose Cilla as his only female performer. He suggested her stage name (changing White to Black), so she and her family could keep their privacy. Martin also agreed to record her, helping choose songs that would showcase her voice. Cilla became popular first in England and Europe, then in America as the Beatles' music started the ""British Invasion"" there in 1964."

It is hard to see the benefit of a long neck under water. Aquatic mammals operating under water all have a streamlined torpedo-shape, as did pliosaurs and ichthyosaurs. All the longer-necked families were, from the setting of the teeth and jaws, eaters of small fish.

An opera is like a play in which everything is sung instead of spoken. Operas are usually performed in opera houses. The singers who sing and act out the story are on the stage, and the orchestra is in front of the stage but lower down, in the orchestra pit, so that the audience can see the stage. Musical numbers of an opera An opera is normally divided into two, three, four or even five acts. In older operas the music was mostly recitative and arias. During the recitative things would happen in the story. The aria was a song for a solo singer, a setting of a lyric. As well as recitative and aria there would be choruses. The chorus were a group of singers who sing in the crowd scenes. The opera would start with an overture for the orchestra. The overture would usually include tunes that are going to be heard later in the opera. In operas from the 19th century onwards there is often little or no difference between recitative and aria. Composers like Wagner wanted to get away from operas which had lots of separate arias in which the singers showed off, with the audience clapping loudly after each one. He wanted continuous music so that the mood would not be broken. Sometimes operas have a lot of dancing in them. French opera especially would often have one act which was full of dances. Types of opera Not all operas have music all the time. Grand opera is opera which is all set to music. Opéra bouffe (French) or Opera buffa (Italian) is comic opera. The story is very light-hearted and funny. Opéra comique is a French term for opera which has some spoken words."

They replace this atom. This reaction is called a substitution reaction. The atom or group of atoms that gets replaced is called the leaving group. The terms substituent, side chain, group, branch, or pendant group are used in the same way to describe branches from a parent structure. These terms have different meanings in polymer chemistry. In polymers, side chains extend from a backbone structure, while they are attached to the alpha carbon atoms of the amino acid backbone in proteins. Organic chemistry has rules for naming compounds with substituent groups. The substituent group is listed first with a suffix to describe how it is attached to the main carbon chain. The suffix -yl is used when naming organic compounds that contain a single bond replacing one hydrogen. -ylidene and -ylidyne are used for double bonds and triple bonds respectively. When naming hydrocarbons that contain a substituent, position numbers may be used. These number will indicate which carbon atom the substituent is attached to. One case where this information is needed is that of isomers. The phrases most-substituted and least-substituted are often used to describe molecules and predict their products. For example: Markovnikov's rule predicts that the hydrogen adds to the carbon of the alkene functional group that has the greater number of hydrogen substituents. Zaitsev's rule predicts that the major reaction product is the alkene with the more highly substituted (more stable) double bond. Structures In a structural diagram or formula, the letters R or X are used to represent a substituent group. An organic substituent such as methyl, ethyl, aryl can be written as R (or R1, R2, etc."

It is a masterwork of Western calligraphy. and Ireland's finest national treasure. The illustrations and ornamentation of the Book of Kells are outstanding. The decoration combines traditional Christian iconography with the ornate swirling motifs typical of the art of the British Isles. Figures of humans, animals and mythical beasts, and Celtic knots and interlacing patterns in vibrant colours, enliven the manuscript's pages. Many of these minor decorative elements have Christian symbolism. The manuscript today is 340 folios (separate sheets, written on one side). Since 1953, it has been bound in four volumes. The leaves are on high-quality calf vellum. There are ten full-page illustrations, and text pages that are vibrant with decorated initials and interlinear miniatures. The writing of the text itself appears to be the work of at least three different scribes. The colours used were gathered from many substances, some of which were imports from distant lands.

The term comes from the French word sans, meaning ""without"" and ""serif"" from the Dutch word schreef meaning ""line"". Sans serif typefaces have been used since the 18th century, but became most used in the twentieth century as the modern art movement developed. Most designers of typefaces were artists. Some were outstanding in other artistic fields, and were part of the wider artistic culture of their times. The apostle of sans serif was Jan Tschichold (2 April 1902 Leipzig, Germany – 11 August 1974 Locarno, Switzerland), a German-Swiss graphic designer. Tschichold not only designed typefaces, he showed how they could be used in the design of book printing. He was a chief designer for Penguin Books after the Second World War. Sans serif faces are most used for display signs, advertising and for headings in books. Although they seem to work well for the text in books, they are much less used for that purpose."

These are called isotopes of the element. Atoms of the same element have the same number of protons, but different isotopes have different numbers of neutrons. Different isotopes of the same element have different masses because they have a different number of neutrons. Mass is the word for how much substance (or matter) something has. Things with different masses also have different weights. Some isotopes are not stable so they change to another isotope or element by radioactive decay. These are called radioactive isotopes. Others are not radioactive. These are called stable isotopes. Atoms of the same element have the same number of protons, which is called the atomic number. Different isotopes of an element have different numbers of neutrons. As a result, they also have different mass numbers, which is the number of protons plus the number of neutrons. An isotope is usually named by giving the element and the mass number. For example, the symbol for carbon is C and all carbon atoms have 6 protons. The most common isotope of carbon also has 6 neutrons, giving a mass number of 12, and it is written carbon-12 or 12C. The isotope of carbon that has 8 neutrons is written carbon-14 or 14C. The word ""isotope"", meaning ""at the same place"", comes from the fact that isotopes of the same element are at the same place on the periodic table. Chemical properties In any neutral atom, the number of electrons is the same as the number of protons. As a result, isotopes of the same element also have the same number of electrons and the same electronic structure."

It is the shrine of Edward the Confessor and the burial place of many kings and queens. Since it was built it has been the place where the coronations of Kings and Queens of England have been held. The present structure dates from 1245, when it was started by Henry III. The status of the Abbey is that of a Royal Peculiar. This means it is place of worship that falls directly under the jurisdiction of the British monarch, rather than under a bishop. The concept dates from Anglo-Saxon times, when a church could ally itself with the monarch and therefore not be subject to the bishop of the area. Technically speaking, it is not a cathedral, though it is regarded as one in practice. One of the most famous tombs at Westminster Abbey is that of the Unknown Warrior. Westminster Abbey and its small parish church, St Margaret's, form a UNESCO World Heritage site, which also includes Westminster Palace. Coronations Since the coronations in 1066 of both King Harold and William the Conqueror, coronations of English and British monarchs were held in the Abbey. Henry III was unable to be crowned in London when he first came to the throne because the French prince Louis (later Louis VIII) had taken control of the city. So the king was crowned in Gloucester Cathedral, but this coronation was deemed by the Pope to be improper, and a further coronation was held in the Abbey on 17 May 1220. The Archbishop of Canterbury is the cleric in the coronation ceremony. King Edward's Chair (or St Edward's Chair), is the throne on which British sovereigns sit when the crown is put on their heads."

Slavery is a condition in which people are owned or completely controlled by other people. Buying and selling slaves is a trade as old as many of the oldest civilizations. A modern form of the slave trade is called human trafficking. History of the slave trade In one form or another slavery has been practiced since the earliest civilizations. Early hunter-gatherers had no use for slaves They did everything for themselves. Having another pair of hands to help them meant another mouth to feed. Slavery or owning another person made no sense to these people. Once men gathered in cities and towns and there was more than enough food, having a cheap supply of labour made sense. This is when the earliest forms of slavery appeared. The main source of slaves was war. When a town was captured, the men were killed and the women were enslaved to work in the fields or as concubines. Slaves made up only a small percentage of the earliest civilizations. These included China's Yangtze River valley, India's Indus Valley, Egypt's Nile valley and the Tigris and Euphrates valleys in Mesopotamia. Early civilizations Once slavery became a major part of the workforce, slave trading became a business. Ancient Greece was the first civilization where slaves made up a large part of the population. Between the 4th and 6th centuries (BC) it is estimated that from one-third to one-half of the population were slaves. There were many sources of slaves. Prisoners captured in war, kidnapping, people selling their children and criminals were some of the more common sources. The market price for slaves would go down after a battle in which many slaves were taken."

It is vitreous (glazed or glassy) pottery made in the United Kingdom in the early 19th century. It is not earthenware, but is similar to fine stoneware. There is no iron in ironstone. Its name is got because it is strong and durable. Ironstone was developed in the 19th century by potters in Staffordshire. It sold well as a cheaper alternative to porcelain. Ironstone in Britain's Staffordshire potteries was made by Charles James Mason after his patent of 1813. The name ""ironstone"" later became generally used. The strength of Mason's ironstone enabled the company to produce ornamental objects of large size. Their vestibule vaseswere 1.5 metres high. Mantelpieces were made from several large sections. Mason's tableware was widely used in hotels and restaurants as well as private homes. It was usual for commercial clients to have the name of their establishment transfer printed onto the stoneware. Mason's was not the only manufacturer. Another high-class pottery was Spode, who made ironstone from 1805 onwards.

One verb is combined with a preposition (like on, in, under) or an adverb (like up, down, away). Sometimes a phrasal verb can have a meaning that is very different to the meaning of at least one of those two or three words separately. Some text books call these verbs multi-word verbs. Phrasal verbs are used more frequently in everyday speech than in formal, official writing or speaking. Here are some examples: Maria didn't know the word, so she looked it up in the dictionary. Oh no, we've run out of milk! I'll have to buy some more. Farmers have to get up early in the morning. The rocket took off with a loud roar. Often these phrasal verbs have a one-word equivalent in other languages. In Spanish, to get up can be translated as levantarse, in French as se lever etc. Types of phrasal verbs There are four different types of phrasal verbs. These are: Phrasal verbs which take objects and are separable Phrasal verbs which take objects and are inseparable Phrasal verbs which do not take objects (these are always inseparable) Three-word phrasal verbs Instead of ""separate"" or ""separable"", some text books use the word ""split"" or ""splittable"". A useful piece of advice to confused students of English is this: If you do not know if a phrasal verb is separable or inseparable ALWAYS use a noun or noun phrase and do not try to separate the verb."

The railway was always in a difficult financial situation. It went bankrupt in 1867 but was able to continue to operate. Many of the difficulties were caused by competition and duplication of services with the South Eastern Railway (SER). However, in 1898 the LCDR agreed with the SER to share the operation of the two railways and work them as a single system under the name South Eastern and Chatham Railway.

It marks the boundary between the North American Plate on the east and the Pacific Plate on the west. The fault was the cause of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. It first appeared about 20 million years ago. The San Andreas Fault is a zone several miles wide with multiple strands. The main active strand runs both on and off-shore between Cape Mendocino and the Sea of Cortez. From Cape Mendocino, it runs offshore to Tomales Bay. Then it goes southward through Bolinas Lagoon, just west of the San Francisco Peninsula, to come onshore again at Daly City, through the hills of the Peninsula. Crystal Springs reservoir is formed by the fault itself. In the Santa Cruz mountains, it bends slightly eastward. This is the site of the 1989 Loma Prieta Earthquake. The fault continues south through the historic mission at San Juan Bautista and through the town of Hollister (where active creep can be seen to offset sidewalks and even houses). The Transverse Ranges north of Santa Barbara are formed by compression. Strands of the fault snake under the Los Angeles Basin. From there it connects into the active spreading under the Sea of Cortez. The San Andreas fault was discovered by Andrew Lawson in 1895, who climbed into the faulted serpentinite well where the south tower of the Golden Gate Bridge was being poured. In spite of the extreme deformation of the serpentinite, Lawson declared the bridge perfectly safe. The events of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake would seem to support his conclusion: the ruptured strand was not the one he observed in the footprint of the bridge."

The natural world heritage area contains 26 caves on 3.05 km² area. Facilities and sights The park is a tourist attraction and has a campground, RV park, group accommodation, picnic areas and a cafe. The number of sights is huge. Cave tours are offered by trained guides. There you can see caves filled with a large number of interesting fossils. With the help of modern technology, visitors can be shown the inside of the normally inaccessible Bat Cave, where thousands of bats breed every year. There are also cave tours for adventurers, a number of special tours and special events. Emergence The limestone in the area was formed by corals and other marine life 200 million years ago when it was below sea level and again about 20 million years ago when the land was again below sea level. Since then, groundwater has loosened part of the limestone, creating the caves. These caves, like the Victoria Fossil Cave or the Blanche Cave, are often not far underground and holes opened up that posed dangers to the unwary. This created a remarkable collection of fossils. Mammals and other land creatures fell into the open holes and were unable to escape. The fossils were preserved in banks of earth washed and blown from the surface of the earth.

It is of spectral type G and luminosity class V on the Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram. The term yellow dwarf is a misnomer, because G-type stars actually range in color from white, for more luminous types like the Sun, to only very slightly yellow for the less massive and luminous G-type main-sequence stars. See spectral classification for a chart of star color by light type. GV stars are small (about 0.8 to 1.0 solar masses) and have a surface temperature of between 5,300 and 6,000 K. Like other main-sequence stars, a GV star turns hydrogen to helium in its core by means of nuclear fusion. Our Sun is the most commonly known (and most easily seen) example of a GV star. Each second, it combines around 600 million tons of hydrogen to helium, changing about 4 million tons of matter to energy. Other GV stars include Alpha Centauri A, Tau Ceti, and 51 Pegasi. Our own Sun looks yellow through the Earth's atmosphere due to Rayleigh scattering. Without that, it would look white. Even though the name ""dwarf"" is used to compare yellow main sequence stars from giant stars, yellow dwarfs like the Sun are 90% brighter than all of the stars in the Milky Way (which are largely orange dwarfs, red dwarfs, and white dwarfs). A GV star fuses hydrogen nuclei together and release energy for around 10 billion years. After the hydrogen is used up, the star will grow to many times its earlier size and become a red giant like Aldebaran."

This meant that instead of things being hand made in small workshops, they were made more cheaply in large quantities by machines in factories. Products being made in large quantity now meant that they were sold for less. It also led to rise in the rate of population growth. It is usually thought as starting in the 1760s. Many people began to move from an agricultural based life in the country to the towns where the factories offered more and better paid work. A Second Industrial Revolution began in the 1870s. Beginnings The Industrial Revolution began in Great Britain in the 18th century. Many of the technological innovations were of British origin. In particular, the County of Shropshire was important, for it had both minerals (e.g. iron ore and coal) and transport on the River Severn. This led to the group of industries near the Ironbridge Gorge and the town of Coalbrookdale. In the mid-18th century Britain was the world's leading trading nation. It controlled a global trading empire with colonies in North America and Africa, and with some political influence on the Indian subcontinent, through the activities of the East India Company. The development of trade and the rise of business were major causes of the Industrial Revolution. The Industrial Revolution marks a major turning point in history. Almost every aspect of daily life was influenced in some way. Average income increased, and population grew rapidly."

Around the world, the minimum wage is enforced as a law that every company must follow. If companies do not give their employees at least the minimum wage, the companies will be forced to pay an expensive fine for breaking the law. Minimum wage is a relative term. Different countries have different minimum wages. Nunavut in Canada has a minimum wage of $11.00 per hour. Ontario, another place in Canada has a minimum wage of $10.25 per hour. Some people think the minimum wage should be raised, so poor working people will have more money and enjoy human rights. Others think it is worse because the government will not have enough money to pay all the employees, so they will raise the taxes or raise the inflation. Some people think that the minimum will hurt employees because companies only hire employees whose labor is worth the price they are required to pay.

Name The name Vaiśravaṇa comes from the Sanskrit viśravaṇa which means ""Great Fame"". Vaiśravaṇa is also known as Kubera in Sanskrit or Kuvera in Pāli. Character The character of Vaiśravaṇa is set up on the Hindu god Kubera, but although the Buddhist and Hindu deities share some characteristics, both of them have different functions and myths. He is often shown with a yellow face. He carries an umbrella as a sign of his power. He is also sometimes shown with a mongoose, often shown spitting out jewels. The mongoose is the enemy of the snake, which is a symbol of greed or hatred; the spitting out of jewels shows generosity. Vaiśravaṇa in Theravāda tradition In the Pāli writings of the Theravāda Buddhist tradition, Vaiśravaṇa is called Vessavaṇa. Vessavaṇa is one of the Four Great Kings, each one of which rules over a direction. Vessavaṇa's direction is the northern quarter of the world. Vessavaṇa has the name ""Kuvera"" from a name he had from a past life as a rich mill-owner, who gave all the money he got from one of his seven mills to charity, and gave aid to the poor for 20,000 years. As with all the Buddhist deities, Vessavaṇa is properly the name of a person who has the god inside him rather than a permanent individual. Each Vessavaṇa is a human, and when he dies, he will be replaced by a new Vessavaṇa. Like other beings of the Cātummahārājika world, his lifespan is 90,000 years, but other sources say nine million years. When the Buddha was born, Vessavaṇa became his follower."

In the 20th century, orcs most often refer to the creatures in J. R. R. Tolkien's Middle-earth books. Tolkien's orcs are human-shaped creatures, and servitors of evil. The word can probably be traced to Orcus. This is a different name for Pluto or Hades. Pliny the Elder writes about orcs in his Naturalis historia. They are long-toothed sea monsters. Ludovico Ariosto (1474-1533)wrote an epic Orlando Furioso: There, the virgin Angelica is captured by a sea monster called orc. The hero, Rogero, is able to free her as he rode a Hippogriff. The Latin name of the Killer Whale, Orcinus orca is }likely to come from that story. There is another creature called orc in Orlando Furioso: a blind man-eating giant who abducts King Norandin of Damascus and his lover Lucina. This orc cannot be vanquished; only fooled by trickery. There is another Orc that lives in the Alps. It is a demon living on mountain tops. It sometimes is described as protector of the forest. At other times it is said to be an evil spirit who brings doom to cattle and wild beasts. From the early Middle Ages, the orc was seen as an evil creature, much like other creatures of Celtic origin."

They are membrane-spanning, that is, they reach from the outside of the cell to the inside. TLRs recognize molecules which come from microbes. Once microbes get through physical barriers such as the skin or intestinal tract mucosa, they are recognized by TLRs. The TLRs set up an immune cell response. TLR signalling leads to the induction or suppression of genes that orchestrate the inflammatory response. In all, thousands of genes are activated by TLR signalling, and the TLRs are one of the most important means of gene modulation. Toll-like receptors have also been shown to be an important link between innate and adaptive immunity through their presence in dendritic cells. Extended family Most mammalian species have between ten and fifteen types of Toll-like receptors. Thirteen TLRs (TLR1 to TLR13) have been identified in humans and mice, and similar ones have been found in other mammalian species. TLRs are not identical in all mammals. For example, a gene coding for a protein like TLR10 in humans is present in mice, but seems to have been damaged at some time by a retrovirus. On the other hand, mice express TLRs 11, 12, and 13, none of which is present in humans. Other mammals may express TLRs that are not found in humans. Non-mammalian species may have TLRs different from mammals. History They got their name from their similarity to the protein coded by the Toll gene identified in Drosophila in 1985 by Christiane Nüsslein-Volhard. The gene in question, when mutated, makes the Drosophila flies look unusual. The researchers were so surprised that they spontaneously shouted out in German ""Das ist ja toll!"" which translates as ""That's great!""."

It was discovered on November 14, 2003 by Mike Brown, Chad Trujillo and David Rabinowitz. Around 1250-1800 km in diameter, Sedna takes roughly 10,500 years to orbit the Sun, much higher than most known trans-Neptunian objects. It is one of the most distant known objects in the Solar System. Therefore, Sedna's surface temperature never rises above -240°C. The name ""Sedna"" comes from the Inuit goddess of the sea, thought to live at the bottom of the Arctic Ocean. NASA is not currently planning any space missions to explore Sedna, but there is some talk of missions to happen when Sedna reaches perihelion again. It is considered to be a likely candidate as a dwarf planet. No pictures can be taken of Sedna because very little light from the Sun reaches it. For this reason, Sedna is known as ""Cobian"", meaning shadows in Ancient Greek. Due to its orbit, the chances of Sedna being found were 0.017%. 40-120 more objects this size should exist without us knowing, but, as they are so small and far away, they may not be discovered for a while."

It was invented by Dr. Richard L. Maddox in 1871. By 1879 the first dry plate factory had been established. With much of the complex chemical work done at the factory, the new process simplified the work of photographers. History The first practical way to take photographs was called the daguerreotype. It was introduced in 1839. It used sheets of copper coated with silver. The plate was then exposed to chemical fumes, then taken to the camera. Introduced in the 1850s the Collodion process was introduced. It used what were called wet plates. But a wet plate had to be prepared and used within minutes. It also had a very slow photographic speed. The preparation of wet plates required numerous chemicals. These had to be mixed in the dark in a portable tent if the photographer was planning on photographing away from the studio. In the 1880s the gelatin dry plate replaced the wet plates. The dry plate allowed much faster exposure times. Now a moving subject could be captured on film. The dry plates could be manufactured in a factory and used whenever the photographer wanted."

Since the discovery of Neovenator on the Isle of Wight, UK, it has become one of the best-known large carnivorous dinosaurs in Europe. Neovenator was about 7.5 meters (24.5 feet) in length, and was of a slim build, weighting 10002000 kg. Some fossils suggest a length of about 10 meters (33 feet), but these fossils are very fragmentary. It lived during the early Cretaceous), about 125 million years ago. Fossil remains of Neovenator have been found on the Isle of Wight (southern England), and were first discovered in the 20th century. Neovenator existed alongside Baryonyx, Polacanthus and Iguanadon in the early Cretaceous. It was one of the top predators of its day. The holotype of Neovenator salerii had many pathologies. They were ""midcaudal vertebrae fusions, healed fractures of mid-caudal vertebra transverse processes; osteophytes affecting pedal phalanges, healed gastralia rib fractures, some forming false joints...

When an organism grows, stem cells specialize, and take specific functions. For instance, mature tissues like skin, muscle, blood, bone, liver, nerves, all have different types of cells. Because stem cells are not yet differentiated, they can change to become some kind of specialized cells. Organisms also use stem cells to replace damaged cells. Stem cells are found in most, if not all, plants and animals. They divide and differentiate into a range of cell types.Research in the stem cell field grew out of findings in the 1960s. The two broad types of mammalian stem cells are embryonic stem cells, and adult stem cells, which are found in adult tissues. In a developing embryo, stem cells can differentiate into all of the specialised embryonic tissues. In adult organisms, stem cells act as a repair system for the body, replenishing specialized cells, but also maintain the normal turnover of blood, skin, and intestinal tissues. Stem cells can be grown in tissue culture. In culture, they can be transformed into specialised cells, such as those of muscles or nerves. Highly plastic adult stem cells can be taken from a variety of sources, including umbilical cord blood and bone marrow. They are now used in medical therapies, and researchers expect that stem cells will be used in many future therapies. Embryonic stem cells Embryonic stem cells (ES cells) are stem cells taken from the inner cell mass of the early stage embryo called a blastocyst. Human embryos reach the blastocyst stage 4-5 days after fertilization. At that time, they are made up of between 50 and 150 cells."

He was the only son of Canute the Great and Emma of Normandy. He followed his father as King of Denmark in 1035, becoming Canute III. Fighting with Magnus I of Norway stopped him from sailing to England to take up his throne. His older, illegitimate half-brother, Harold Harefoot, became regent of England. Harold took the English crown for himself in 1037. After Harthacanute had settled the situation in Scandinavia he prepared an invasion of England to take over his kingdom. Harold died, and Harthacanute was able to take back his throne peacefully. Harthacanute was a harsh and unpopular ruler. To pay for his ships, he greatly increased the rate of taxation. In 1041, the people of Worcester killed two of Harthacanute's men who had been collecting the tax. Harthacanute burned the city. The story of Lady Godiva riding naked through the streets of Coventry to persuade the local earl to lower taxes, may come from the reign of Harthacanute. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle says of him: ""He never accomplished anything kingly for as long as he ruled"". In 1041, Harthacanute asked his half-brother Edward the Confessor (his mother Emma's son by Ethelred the Unready) back from exile in Normandy to become a member of his household, and probably made Edward his heir. Harthacanute was unmarried and had no children. On 8 June 1042, he died at Lambeth— he ""died as he stood at his drink, and he suddenly fell to the earth"". He was buried at Winchester Cathedral, Hampshire. Edward became the new king."

They are often similar to real life in some ways, but can also be very strange. Dreams can be so real, the person dreaming may not believe they are awake. This tends to happen during a false awakening, where a person dreams of waking up. A person has around 4 - 6 dreams per night, and tend to only remember the last two. Sometimes a person realizes during a dream that they are dreaming, but keeps having the dream. This is called a lucid dream. This happens very little for most people, but for some people it happens often. During a lucid dream, a person usually has full control over their body, as well as the environment around them. There are no limits in lucid dreams, sometimes not even the imagination. Most people remember their dreams in some way or another, even if it is only a small part, but children are very likely to remember most of their dream clearly. It is often easier for people to remember dreams if they write down what happened in the dream just after they wake up. Because of this, many people have dream diaries where they describe each dream they have. This is called dream recall, and the more it is done the better they remember their dreams. If a person is woken up during a dream, they tend to have a much more reliable memory of it. Nightmares are dreams which scare or shock people. Nightmares are usually based around that person's everyday fears, like spiders or dark places, but even a dream that's not about those things can feel unpleasant."

It is an amusing as well as scary creature described by a mother's imagination to her child, to stop his cry. Etymologically, ""Tapta"" is made of two words, ""Tap"" (sound of water drops falling on the ground) and ""Ta"" (literally meaning ""to fall"") in Meitei (Manipuri). Once there was a child who never stopped crying. One night, when it was raining heavily, a thief came to steal a horse from the house of the child and a tiger also came to prey on one of the horses from the same place. As the two criminals were silently waiting a right time for their chances in the dark corners of the horse-stable, they heard the mother (""father"" in another version) telling her child about many scary creatures, like the elephant, the horse, the lion and the tiger coming, to pacify his crying but it was of no use to the child. And the non-stop weeping child suddenly remained silent when the mother mentioned the name ""Tapta"". So, both the thief and the tiger believed that ""Tapta"" might surely be a dangerous creature. In the darkness, the thief started searching for the horses in the horse-stable. And as he was touching things one by one in the darkness, it coincided that he held the legs of the hiding tiger, thinking it as one of the horses in the stable.

According to the teaching of transubstantiation, although the appearance, smell, and taste of bread and wine remain, the substances of bread and wine have really changed into the body and blood of Jesus. Transubstantiation is also taught by some other Christian churches. Beliefs about transubstantiation Christians who believe in transubstantiation believe that the bread they eat at Mass is the body of Jesus. They know that the bread still tastes like bread, looks like bread and smells like bread. It is just like bread, but it becomes the body of Jesus. The priest says prayers at Mass so that the bread and wine become the flesh and blood of Jesus. This started when Jesus ate a meal called the Last Supper the night before he died. He said that the food his friends were eating was his body and blood. In the Gospel of Matthew 26:26, it says, ""Take this [bread] all of you and eat it. This is my body which will be given up for you,"" which means that he would die for them. Then, in Matthew 26:27, Jesus said, ""Take this [cup] all of you and drink from it. This is the cup of my blood, the blood of the new and everlasting covenant."" This means that Jesus's blood would make a promise forever between God and his people. Then he said, ""My blood will be shed for you and for all so that sins may be forgiven."" This means that Jesus would die for everyone so their sins, or things they do wrong, could be forgiven."

The word is often used when talking about the 17th and 18th centuries, but the word has been used since the English Civil War and is still used today. Someone who said they would join the army was given the coin, but could give it back before they made a promise to a judge. Once the promise was made, they were given more money. The amount of money they were given changed over the years. In 1812, a new soldier was given £23, 17 shillings and six pence. This money was a lot, which persuaded many people to join the army, but the money was spent very quickly on uniform.

This is where the structure's superstructure rests or contacts. Single-span bridges have abutments at each end. These provide vertical and lateral (side to side) support for the bridge. They also act as retaining walls to resist lateral movement of the earthen fill of the bridge approach. Multi-span bridges require piers to support ends of spans that are not supported by abutments. Dam abutments are generally the natural valley walls. They may also be artificial in order to support arch dams such as Kurobe Dam in Japan. The term may also refer to the structure supporting one side of an arch, or masonry used to resist the lateral forces of a vault. The word derives from the verb ""abut"", meaning to ""touch by means of a mutual border""."

Some rebels in history were slaves who fought back against their masters or against slavery in general. Leader of slave rebellions include Spartacus and Nat Turner. An example would be the Zhou dynasty in China who made the rulers of other Chinese states that they captured live with their own families in the Zhou capital, Anyang.

Grist can refer to both the grain that has been separated from its chaff and to the ground grain. Most old ones are watermills. They typically have a waterwheel and from 1 to 3 stones for grinding, although some have more. Water pours on to the wheel causing it to spin. This movement causes an axle inside to turn. The axle is connected to a gear which causes the grinding stones to spin. At the top, there is a chute filled with grain. The grain slowly falls through into the grinding stones. There are different ways to transmit power from the waterwheel to the stones. The simplest method is known as a single-geared drive. Only one set of gears is used to drive a single stone. This arrangement was used since vertical waterwheels were used in gristmills and was still used until the 19th century. Another method was known as spur-wheel drive. This method used a set of bevelled gears that would drive a horizontal 'spur-wheel', a large gearwheel that would then drive up to 3 or 4 millstones. Another arrangement was known as a layshaft drive. The waterwheel would drive a horizontal 'layshaft' with gears mounted on it. Each gear would drive one set of stones."

He was a member of an artillery (gun) crew. A matross ranked next below a gunner. The duty of a matross was to assist the gunners in loading, firing and sponging the guns. They were armed with muskets and bayonets. They marched with the store-wagons, acting as guards. In the American army a matross ranked as a private of artillery. History Matrosses were first used in the British Army in 1639. Before that they were called gunner's assistants. In the German language a matrose means a sailor. The work assigned to the matross was considered sailor's work on a ship. It was an effort to give the assistant a respectable title. But their pay rate remained the same. In 1873 all matrosses were promoted to the rank of gunner. The rank of matross was no longer used. A soldier's manual for artillery used by Americans in the Revolutionary war gave a detailed instruction for a matross. In part it said: By the War of 1812 an ideal gun crew could be up to 15 men. Each man would have a specific task in the sequence of loading and firing the artillery piece. Often a non-commissioned officer would commanded the gun crew and aimed the gun. Like the other gun crew members, the matross had a specific place to stand as he performed his duties."

Usually it is located near the sea. The ponds can be filled with salt water. The water is then left to evaporate. The salt is left behind, and can be harvested. Such ponds also provide a habitat for several kinds of animals. Most of these animals are birds. The color tells how much salt there is left in the water. Green colors come from special algae. These algae are there in low to mid salinity ponds (ponds with little salt in the water). In middle to high salinity ponds, an alga called Dunaliella salina shifts the color to red. Millions of tiny brine shrimp create an orange cast in mid-salinity ponds. Other bacteria such as Stichococcus also contribute tints. These colors are especially interesting to airplane passengers or astronauts passing above due to their somewhat artistic formations of shape and color."

Legend Lady Godiva was the wife of Earl Leofric of Mercia. The Earl’s taxes were very high, and people in Coventry was very upset about it. Lady Godiva begged her husband to lower the taxes many times, but he never agreed to. Finally, the Earl told Lady Godiva that if she rode through the streets completely naked, he would lower the taxes.

It is a type of annelid. There are 5,500 known species of earthworms in 21 families. They are found everywhere, except in polar or dry climates. Their sizes vary: they can be between two centimeters and about three meters in length. The biggest known earthworm is the giant Gippsland earthworm, found in Australia. It is usually about 80 cm in length, but can grow to about 3 meters. The most common earthworm (in Europe, and most other temperate climate regions) grows to a size of about 20–25 cm when extended. Most earthworms can regrow lost segments, assuming the worm has not had too much damage. This capability varies by species. Long ago, all animals looking like worms were lumped together by John Ray and by Linnaeus in their classifications. Later, biologists found that some were in quite different groups. Roundworms and flatworms are different phyla. Inchworms are a type of caterpillar, and the slow-worm is a legless lizard. Physical characteristics The average earthworm is a reddish brown color, with a pointed posterior and anterior end. There are no eyes or other discerning facial features, only a simply opening for a mouth. Earthworms have long, segmented bodies, covered in microscopic setae, or bristles, which help to anchor and pull the worm via longitudinal muscle contractions. Earthworms have no lungs, and absorb oxygen directly through their skin. In order to do this, they must stay moist, and do so by lubricating their skin with glands along their bodies. Earthworms are invertebrates, lacking a skeleton. To support and shape the body, they are filled with coelomic fluid. Earthworms sometimes appear to have a ""belt"" or ""saddle"" around their bodies; this is a clitelum, a structure containing maturing eggs."

The rest of the Yahi (as well as many members of their parent tribe, the Yana) were killed in the California genocide in the 19th century. Ishi lived most of his life isolated from modern American culture. In 1911, aged 50, he came out near the foothills of Lassen Peak in Northern California. Ishi, which means ""man"" in the Yana language, is an adopted name. The anthropologist Alfred Kroeber gave him this name because in the Yahi culture, tradition demanded that he not speak his own name until formally introduced by another Yahi. When asked his name, he said: ""I have none, because there were no people to name me,"" meaning that there was no other Yahi to speak his name for him. Ishi was taken in by anthropologists at the University of California, Berkeley, who both studied him and hired him as a janitor. He lived most of his remaining five years in a university building in San Francisco. His life was shown and discussed in many films and books. A popular biography was Ishi in Two Worlds published by Theodora Kroeber in 1961. Biography Early life In 1865, Ishi and his family were attacked in the Three Knolls Massacre, in which 40 of their tribesmen were killed. Although 33 Yahi survived to escape, cattlemen killed about half of the survivors. The last survivors, including Ishi and his family, went into hiding for the next 44 years. Their tribe was believed to be extinct. Prior to the California Gold Rush of 1848–1855, the Yahi population numbered 404 in California, but the total Yana in the larger region numbered 2,997."

They were arranged in four male-female pairs, with the males associated with frogs, and the females with snakes. Their story is part of the Egyptian creation myth. The Egyptians believed that before the world was formed, there was a watery mass of dark, directionless chaos. In this chaos lived the Ogdoad of Khmunu (Hermopolis). These were four frog gods and four snake goddesses of chaos. Together they represented balance in infinity. Their names were Nun and Naunet (water), Amun and Amaunet (invisibility), Heh and Hauhet (infinity) and Kek and Kauket (darkness). The chaos existed without the light, and thus Kek and Kauket came to represent this darkness. They also symbolized obscurity, the kind of obscurity that went with darkness, and night. The Ogdoad were the original great gods of Iunu (On, Heliopolis) where they were thought to have helped with creation, then died and retired to the land of the dead where they continued to make the Nile River flow and the sun rise every day."

It sold over 82 million copies by the end of 2017. This makes it the best selling single-platform game of all time, and fourth best overall. Gameplay Wii Sports is a collection of five separate sports games: tennis, baseball, bowling, golf, and boxing. The games use the motion-sensing Wii Remote in different ways. When playing the games, the player moves the Wii Remote in a similar way to how the games are played in real life. They can hold and swing the Wii Remote like a golf club, baseball bat or bowling ball. Some parts of the gameplay are computer controlled.

It eats insects. It is grey on top and light grey underneath with pink on the sides. The wings are dark and it has a long black tail. It is named ""scissor-tailed"" because its tail looks like a pair of scissors. The tail is shorter when it is young, and the bird is not as colorful. The scissor-tailed flycatcher is closely related to the kingbirds. It is also the state bird of Oklahoma. The common name is derived from its former Latin name-Muscivoria forficata, meaning ""flying""-""scissors"" and ""to devour."" In Oklahoma, scissortails can be found on open prairies, along tree-lined roads, and along roadsides perched on fences, limbs and in isolated trees. They consume a great number of grasshoppers, crickets, spiders, and other ground-dwelling insects making them economically important and popular with farmers and ranchers. Soon after the birds arrive in the state, the males begin their famous ""sky dance,"" a popular site along roadsides during spring and early summer. After climbing about 100 feet in the air, the male makes a series of V-shaped flights, then plunges down in an erratic zigzag course often somersaulting while uttering a rolling, cackling call. The performance has been described as ""an aerial ballet of incomparable grace."" Nesting usually takes place in an isolated tree 7–30 feet above ground. Often two broods of 4-6 each are raised during the summer. Scissor-tailed flycatchers are easily identified by their long scissor-like tail, which may reach nine inches in length. During flight the bird opens its tail like a pair of scissors and folds or closes the ""scissors"" when perching."

Srinivasa Ramanujan gave a simpler proof. Ramanujan later used that proof when he discovered Ramanujan primes. In 1932, Paul Erdős published a simpler proof using the Chebyshev function θ(x)."

He was an author who wrote about images in media. He thought that violent imagery in mass media and comic books was harmful to children. His best-known book was Seduction of the Innocent (1954). After this book became popular, the United States Congress took a close look at the comic book industry. Also, the Comics Code was made in response. He called television ""a school for violence"". Biography He was born on 20 March 20 1895 in Munich. He studied medicine in Germany and England. He and Sigmund Freud wrote letters to each other, and Wertham chose to study mainly psychiatry. In 1922 he was asked to come to the United States and to join the Phipps Psychiatric Clinic at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland. He became a United States citizen in 1927. He moved to New York City in 1932. He became the director of a psychiatric clinic connected with the New York Court of General Sessions. All people who were convicted of serious crimes had a psychiatric examination there. The report from those examinations were used in court.

The group is the Phlebotominae, a subfamily of flies. Parasitic diseases spread by the flies include leishmaniasis, bartonellosis and pappataci fever. In the New World leishmaniasis is spread by sand flies in the genus Lutzomyia. Lutzomyia often live in caves, where their main hosts are bats. In the Old World sand flies in the genus Phlebotomus spread leishmaniasis. Phlebotomine females, and only females, suck blood from various mammals, reptiles and birds. Some species are selective, whereas others bite any suitable host they find. As far as is known all species need a blood meal for every following clutch of eggs after the first. Proteins and other nutrients in the blood enable the female to produce eggs. The flies use their mouthparts to start the host bleeding. They then suck up the exposed blood. Like practically all blood-feeding parasites, they inject biochemicals that inhibit blood clotting, plus some that stimulate host mast cells to produce histamine; this distend capillary vessels, thereby promoting blood flow. One blood meal can support the production of about 100 eggs. Females lay their eggs in humid soil rich in organic matter. Sand flies are small; a body size of about 3mm in length is typical. This helps them in escape notice. Their bite is not always felt, but leaves a small round, reddish bump that starts itching hours or days later. Use of insect repellent is recommended in areas where sand flies are present."

He is generally thought of as the first in a line of great artists of the Italian Renaissance. Giovanni Villani, who lived at the same time as Giotto, wrote that he was the king of painters, who drew all his figures as if they were alive. Villani says that, because he was so clever, the city of Florence gave him a salary. In the 16th century, the biographer Giorgio Vasari says that Giotto changed painting from the Byzantine style of other artists of his day, and brought to life the great art of painting as it was made by the later Renaissance painters like Leonardo da Vinci. This was because Giotto drew his figures from life, rather than copying the style them from old well-known pictures in the way that the Byzantine artists like Cimabue and Duccio did. Giotto's greatest work is the decoration of the Scrovegni Chapel in Padua, finished around 1305. The building is sometimes called the ""Arena Chapel"" because it is on the site of an Ancient Roman arena. This fresco series shows the life of the Virgin and the life of Christ. It is thought of as one of the greatest masterpieces of the Early Renaissance. Although Vasari wrote about Giotto's life, it is not known how many of the stories are true, because Vasari was writing more than 200 years after Giotto died. Only two things are known for certain. It is known that in 1334 Giotto was chosen by the ""commune"" (town council) of Florence to design the bell tower next to Florence Cathedral which was being built at that time. It is also known for certain that Giotto painted the ""Arena Chapel""."

It is one of the many members of the family Malacanthidae. It is the only species within the genus Malacanthus. Description Fish from the family Malacanthidae have streamlined bodies and large crests on their head. They have relatively long dorsal fins and anal fins. The blue blanquillo gets its name from its mainly blue colour. It also has some shades of yellow, and can change colour in different situations. On their backs, there is a set of stripes that run across its body. Their belly is white. The colour of the head changes from a light blue to a pinkish mix during spawning season. Where they live Blue blanquillo fish are usually found in the Indo-Pacific area. They live anywhere from the Red Sea to the Line Islands, north to southern Japan and south to New Caledonia and the Cook Islands. They are often seen in areas around coral reefs near the sea floor. Behaviour Malacanthus latovittatus does not swim in groups. They are often found swimming alone or two together. They are known to clean other fish. They also mimic the wrasse to stop predators from eating it. The fish can swim at depths of . The temperatures of the water it swims in normally range from . They tend to swim high above the floor of the sea. This is so that they can pick prey from the ground with their eyesight, which is very good.

They are named after the city of Nuremberg where the legislative assembly met. They were: Gesetz zum Schutze des deutschen Blutes und der deutschen Ehre (Often called Blutschutzgesetz, law concerning the protection of German blood and honour). This law made it illegal for Jews to marry non-Jews. It also made it illegal for these people to have sex with each other. The law provided for long prison terms for men who did not obey it. Women could go away without prison term (if they told about it). This law also forbade Jews to show the national flag, and guaranteed their right to show Jewish symbols. Reich Citizenship Law : This law basically said that only people of German or closely-related blood could become citizens - in other words: Jews (and some others) could not. All Jews employed by the government had to quit their job. They also lost their right to vote and to be in the army.

It was a thyreophoran, a lightly plated, herbivorous dinosaur about 4 metres long. It lived during the early Jurassic, 208 to 194 million years ago. Its fossils have been found in England, Ireland, and in Arizona, in the United States. Scelidosaurus has been called the earliest complete dinosaur. This and related genera have been found on three continents. It is one of the earliest and most basal of the armoured dinosaurs. A review by Serano had Scelidosaurus as the sister group (closest relative) to both the Stegosauria and Ankylosauria. A full-grown Scelidosaurus was rather small, compared to some later dinosaurs. Its length was about 4 metres (13 ft). Scelidosaurus was quadrupedal, with the hindlimbs longer than the forelimbs. It may have reared up on its hind legs to browse on foliage from trees, but its forefeet were as large as its hind feet, indicating a mostly quadrupedal posture. Scelidosaurus and its Jurassic relatives were herbivorous. Other ornithischians had teeth capable of grinding plant material, but Scelidosaurus had smaller, less complex teeth. Its jaw could only do simple up-and-down movements. In this aspect, they resembled the stegosaurids, which also had primitive teeth and simple jaws. Also, like stegosaurs, they may have swallowed gastroliths to aid processing of food (because of the lack of chewing ability). This is also done by modern birds and crocodiles. The diet of Scelidosaurus was low-lying plants like ferns and cycads. Seaweed has also been suggested as a food. Grass did not evolve until the Cretaceous period."

Yeast is added and the mash vessel is closed airtight with airlock. The yeast will ferment the sugar into alcohol. The fermented mash is then distilled. It can be made either in simple pot still or sophisticated industrial patent still. If the still used is a pot still, the distillation is usually repeated at least twice to remove any foul-tasting or poisonous impurities away. If the still used is a patent still, the result is spirit; very high contents alcohol unsuitable for drinking. Pure water is added to lower the alcohol contents to desired. This is called dilution. Unlike cognac or whisky, vodka is not usually matured in barrels, but bottled immediately. Some Scandinavian vodkas called akvavit (Latin aqua vitae, ""water of life"") are matured in oak barrels before they are bottled."

There are two known species, Avimimus portentosus and Avimimus nemegtensis. Flight? The forelimbs were relatively short. The bones of the hand were fused together, as in modern birds, and a ridge on the ulna (lower arm bone) was interpreted as an attachment point for feathers by Kurzanov. Kurzanov, in 1987, also reported the presence of quill knobs, and while Chiappe confirmed the presence of bumps on the ulna, their function remained unclear. Kurzanov was so convinced they were attachment points for feathers that he concluded that Avimimus may have been capable of weak flight.

With deer, only males have antlers. Only reindeer (caribou) have antlers on the females, and these are normally smaller than those of the males. Growth of antlers While an antler is growing, it is covered with highly vascular skin called velvet, which supplies oxygen and nutrients to the growing bone. Antlers are one of the most striking cases of male secondary sex characteristics in the animal kingdom. They grow faster than any other mammal bones. Growth occurs at the tip, and is initially cartilage, which is mineralized to become bone. Once the antler has achieved its full size, the velvet is lost and the antler's bone dies. This dead bone structure is the mature antler. The antlers fall off at some point. To re-grow antlers each year uses up nutrition, so they are honest signals of food gathering capability. Sexual selection The principle means of evolution of antlers is sexual selection, which operates by two mechanisms: Male–male competition (behaviorally, physiologically) and female mate choice. Male–male competition can take place in two forms. First, they can compete when males use their antlers as weapons to compete for mates; second, they can compete where males present their antlers to display their strength and fertility. Males with the largest antlers are more likely to obtain mates and achieve fertilization success."

The brain arranges, sorts, and organises data from the senses. Normally the system works well. Sometimes it does not, and we see illusions. In general, they are shared by most people in the same situation. Illusions can happen with all five senses (taste, touch, sight, smell, and hearing), and some involve the way information from two senses is put together. Some illusions happen because of disorders, but generally, all normal people can sense the same illusion. An illusion is different from a hallucination; a halucination is sensing something which is not real, but an illusion is interpreting what we sense wrongly. Optical illusions Optical illusions are the best known and understood. Because they are illusions common to most people, it follows that they are a product of the visual system. The visual system, from the retina to the visual cortex, is what is common to most humans. Auditory illusions These are illusions which are heard. The person listening hears sounds that aren’t really there, or sounds that can’t really happen. A Shepard tone is an auditory illusion. Touch illusion They are when a person feels something that is not there, or something that should not be there but feels like it is. This happens sometimes when a person loses their arm. The person still feels like the arm is there. They might want to scratch the arm, or the arm might hurt them. This can happen with any limb of the body, and it is called the phantom limb."

The plant is part of the genus Nicotiana and of the Solanaceae (nightshade) family. History Native Americans used tobacco before Europeans arrived in the Americas. The earliest know use of tobacco comes from nicotine residue from a pipe in the Southeastern United States. It is Radiocarbon dated at 1685-1530 BC. Europeans in the Americas learned to smoke and brought it back to Europe, where it became very popular. At that time tobacco was usually smoked in a pipe. The Europeans who moved to America started to farm tobacco so that they could sell it in Europe. This became one of the main causes of the African slave trade. In 1610 a European man called John Rolfe arrived in the American state of Virginia and set up a tobacco farm which made him very rich. Rolfe was the first non-native farmer to use nicotiana tabacum, which is the type of tobacco most commonly smoked today. He also married Pocahontas, a Native American woman who became famous when she went to live in London. In the 17th and 18th centuries tobacco made farmers very rich and towns quickly grew in the states of Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina. In 1883 one third of United States tax money came from tobacco. In 1864 the first American tobacco factory opened to produce 20 million cigarettes annually. By 1964 the cigarette contained over 500 added chemicals. Today tobacco manufacturers are still not required by law to list the 500+ ingredients. Tobacco and health Tobacco users (especially smokers) and people around them (with passive smoking) risk many very serious and often deadly illnesses, such as cancer, strokes, heart disease, and lung disease."

No known life can live without it. Lakes, oceans, seas, and rivers are made of water. Precipitation is water that falls from clouds in the sky. It may be rain (liquid) if it is warm, or it may be frozen if it is cold. If water gets very cold (below ), it freezes and becomes ice, the frozen variant of water. If water gets very hot (above ), it boils and becomes steam or water vapor. It is moved around in the water cycle. Water is essential for life. Physical chemistry of water Water is a fluid. Water is the only chemical substance on Earth that exists naturally in three states. There are over 40 anomalies (strange things) about water. Unlike most other liquids such as alcohol or oil, when water freezes, it expands by about 9%. This expansion can cause pipes to break if the water inside them freezes. Water is a molecule made of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. Its chemical formula is H2O. Like other liquids, water has a surface tension, so a little water can make drops on a surface, rather than always spreading out to wet the surface. Things having something to do with water may have ""hydro"" or ""aqua"" in their name, such as hydropower or aquarium, from the Greek and Latin names for water. It is also called the ""universal solvent"", because it dissolves many other compounds. In small amounts, water appears to have no colour but in large amounts (such as seas or lakes), it has a very light blue color. Uses of water Plants and animals (including people) are mostly water inside, and must drink water to live."

On that website, Ray explained his theory of everything, known as ""Time Cube"". It described the planet Earth as having a cubic symmetry, and time as rotating four ""corners"". He also said that all of modern physics is wrong. Scientists reject these ideas, saying that they make no sense and cannot be tested. The Time Cube website was written in an angry and hateful voice. On his site, Ray said that not believing in Time Cube would be ""stupid and evil"". Some of the comments were racist and discriminatory, especially against black people and Jews. There were also many comments against gay people. Many people found the site to be difficult to understand. Ray spoke about Time Cube at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in January 2002. At MIT, a professor tried to cancel the lecture before it took place. Ray believed this is proof of a conspiracy to keep information about Time Cube hidden.

Some people think he is part of the folk revival in indie pop, but he gets ideas from many things. His music is similar to electronica and the minimalism of Steve Reich. Stevens says that he has plans to make a concept album for each of the 50 U.S. states. He began with Michigan (2003) and Illinois (2005). Stevens was born in Detroit, Michigan, and grew up in Petoskey. He went to Harbor Light Christian School as well as the Interlochen Arts Academy. He also learned at Hope College in Holland, Michigan. Sufjan is an Arabic name that famously belonged to Abu Sufyan, a man from early Islamic history. The name was given to Stevens by the person who founded Subud, a spiritual community. Stevens said in an interview, ""It sounds like Devendra Banhart kind of grew up in this strange kind of cultish environment, and I don't mean that word in a demeaning way. I think we probably come from similar backgrounds. There's a little bit of that in my history."" Stevens is a multi-instrumentalist, a person who can play many musical instruments. He is well known for his use of the banjo, but also plays guitar, piano, drums, and several other instruments, often playing all of these on his albums by using multitrack recording. When he was in school, he learned the oboe and English horn, which he also plays on his albums. He is one of the few musicians in pop music to use these instruments. A lot of instruments are played in unison to give his songs a ""symphony-like"" sound. Strings and horns are used very often in many of his songs."

To the person getting the cheque, it is a paper that allows them to go to a bank and get money. To the person writing the cheque, it is a promise to pay the bank that is giving the money to the person who turned the cheque in. Cheques must be written to a person or business. A cheque that is not written to anyone can be very bad because if it is lost, anyone who finds it can get the money. A cheque that is written to a person but does not have the amount of money written is a blank cheque. Cheques have been used since over a thousand years ago. However, they became popular in the 20th century for paying money without using cash. Parts of a cheque The four main parts of a cheque are: Drawer, the person who makes the cheque Payee, the person who gets the money Drawee, the bank that pays the money for the cheque Amount, the amount that has to be paid When more people started to use cheques, more things were added to make them more secure and easy to track. They started to require the drawer's signature to be confirmed. The signature on a cheque is the main way to tell if a cheque is real. Cheques also started to need the amount written in words and numbers. This made it harder to make mistakes and harder to change the cheque after it was already written.

It orbits within the Cybele Group, beyond most of the main belt asteroids. It has a very dark surface and is made of carbonate. It was found by N. R. Pogson on November 17, 1868, and named after Camilla, Queen of the Volsci in Roman mythology. Study of its light curve shows that Camilla's pole probably points towards ecliptic coordinates (β, λ) = (+51°, 72°) with a 10° uncertainty, which gives it an axial tilt of 29°. Moon (S/2001 (107) I) On March 1, 2001, a moon of Camilla was found by A. Storrs, F. Vilas, R. Landis, E. Wells, C. Woods, B. Zellner, and M. Gaffey using the Hubble Space Telescope. It has been labelled S/2001 (107) 1 but it does not yet have an official name. Later sightings in September 2005 with the VLT allowed scientists to work out its orbit. Apart from data in infobox, the inclination was found to be 3 ± 1° with respect to an axis pointing towards (β, λ) = (+55°, 75°). Given the ~10° uncertainty in the actual rotational axis of Camilla, the orbit's inclination probably is less than 10°. The moon is estimated to be about 11 km in diameter. If it has the same density as Camilla, this would give it a mass of about ~1.5 kg. It has a similar colour to Camilla."

The Sun is orbited by planets, asteroids, comets and other things. The Solar System is about 4.6 billion years old. It formed by gravity in a large molecular cloud. Most of this matter came together in the center, and the rest flattened into an orbiting disk that became the Solar System. It is thought that almost all stars form by this process. The Sun is a star. It makes up 99.9% of the Solar System's mass. This means that it has strong gravity. The other objects are pulled into orbit around the Sun. The Sun is mostly made out of hydrogen, and some helium and higher elements. There are eight planets in the Solar System. From closest to farthest from the Sun, they are: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. The first four planets are called terrestrial planets. They are mostly made of rock and metal, and they are mostly solid. The last four planets are called gas giants. This is because they are much larger than other planets and are mostly made of gas. Titan, one of Saturn’s moons, is the only moon in the solar system to have an Atmosphere. The Solar System also contains other things. There are asteroid belts, mostly between Mars and Jupiter. Further out than Neptune, there is the Kuiper belt and the scattered disc. These areas have dwarf planets, including Pluto, Makemake, Haumea, Ceres and Eris. There are thousands of very small objects in these areas. There are also comets, centaurs, and interplanetary dust.

It is the only species of the Ailuridae family. There are two subspecies: Ailurus fulgens fulgens and Ailurus fulgens styani. Overview Most that are bred at Japanese zoos are Ailurus fulgens styani. They are called レッサーパンダ in Japan and 小熊貓 (xiǎo xìong māo ) in China, both literally translating to English as ""small bear cat"". They have become popular for how they look. The IUCN classes them as 'vulnerable' The red panda is not closely related to the giant panda: they are in different families, but share a vegetarian diet. They have both adapted to eating plant material, which is unusual for members of the Carnivora. A scientist by the name Brian Houghton Hodgson was one of the first people to look more deeply into the Red Panda because up until he did, there was not much known about the species. In addition to Bamboo, the Red Panda also eats fruits, tuberous roots, acorns, and beechmast. The Red Panda is not necessarily nocturnal but is classified as crepuscular which means they are active around dawn and sleep during the night and midday. Besides how they slept, Hodgson observed that they were monogamous and only breed once a year. Habitat The red panda lives in the southern part of China, Sikkim, Nepal, and the Himalaya mountains in high trees. In the Indian kingdom of Sikkim it is the state animal. As an endangered species it is protected by laws in the countries where it lives. 2 nearly complete skeletons have been found at the Gray Fossil Site in Gray, Tennessee. Appearance and life Red pandas are about 50-60 centimeters long. They weigh between three and five kilograms. They have chestnut colored hair, and their faces have white designs."

She was sometimes called ""The Empress of the Blues"" and was very popular in the 1920s and 1930s. A lot of people think that she was one of the best singers of her time, and along with Louis Armstrong, she was an important influence on later jazz singers. Early life In the 1900 American census, Bessie Smith's mother, Laura Smith, said that Bessie was born in Chachanooga, Tennessee in July 1892. In the census in 1910, her sister, Viola Smith said that Bessie's birthday was April 15, 1894. That is the date that is on all later documents, and was the one that Smith used. She was the daughter of Laura and William Smith. William Smith was a laborer and part-time Baptist preacher who died before his daughter was old enough to remember him. By the time she was nine, her mother had died as well, and her older sister Viola had to look after for her sisters and brothers. To earn money for their poor family, Smith and her brother Andrew began Busking (performing) on the streets of Chattanooga as a duo. She sang and danced, and he accompanied her on guitar. They liked to perform in front of the White Elephant Saloon in the middle of Chattanooga's African-American community. In 1904, Smith's oldest brother, Clarence, ran away from home and joined small traveling troupe owned by Moses Stokes. ""If Bessie had been old enough, she would have gone with him,"" said Clarence's widow, Maud. ""That's why he left without telling her, but Clarence told me she was ready, even then.

Because of this, the island was shown on a map. Later, the islands were removed from maps. Some islands are described and later on change their name, or with the description given it is possible to associate a real island. Other islands sink below sea level because of natural causes such as erosion. Such islands still exist. Two examples are Earnest Legouve Reef and Maria-Theresa Reef in the South Pacific. Because they are far away from ships' routes, their existence can not be proved so far. In the year 1908, Robert Peary claimed to have found a lost continent, called Crocker Land. People such as João Vaz Corte-Real were rewarded for finding islands that turned out to be phantom islands. In the case given, the phantom island was Bacalao. The island showed up on maps in the early 16th century. Baccalieu Island is probably named after the phantom island. Some phantom islands were later found. That way Baja California was first thought to be an island. Later, people found it was in fact a peninsula. Thule was discovered in antiquity; in modern times, people who found it may have talked about Norway, the Orkney Islands, Shetland or Scandinavia. Other interpretations include Iceland, Greenland, or the island Saaremaa in the Baltic Sea. Other phantom islands may exist because of mistakes in navigation, or optical illusions, such as superior mirage. One example of this is New South Greenland, which was observed in the Weddell Sea in 1823, and has not been seen since. Some phantom islands may have existed, but they have been destroyed, or are no longer above the water line."

Many fish (sharks, rays, and catfish) can detect electric fields: they are 'electroreceptive'. They cannot make electric fields, and are not called electric fish. Strongly and weakly electric fish Electric fish have a special organ that makes electricity. This organ is called an electric organ. It is usually near the tail of the fish. It is made from specialised muscle or nerve cells. When the organ releases electricity this is called an electric organ discharge (or EOD for short). Based on the strength of the EOD, the electrogenic fish are two types: Strongly electric fish: Their discharge is so strong they can stun (and capture) prey with it. Examples of such fish are the electric eel (which is a knifefish, not a true eel), electric catfishes, or electric rays Weakly electric fish: Their discharge is not strong enough to stun prey with it; rather, they use the electricity to locate objects, to navigate, or to communicate with other electric fish. Examples of weakly electric fish are Peters' elephantnose fish or the black ghost knifefish. In total, there are 348 known species of electric fish, in about 56 genera. The only known species that lives in salt water are the electric rays, with 23 species."

The Australian magpie is in its own genus Gymnorhina and is related to the black butcherbird (Melloria quoyi). They live in bush land and in cities near people. Description Australian magpies are from 37 to 43 cm long. They do not have very long tails like European magpies. An adult magpie has red eyes, black legs, and a white beak with black tip. There are nine kinds of magpies (subspecies or races) in different parts of the country. Some subspecies have black backs and some have white. Behaviour They walk on the ground where they look for insects and lizards to eat. Many other birds hop (move with small jumps), but magpies walk. When they are not looking for food, they stand or perch by holding on with their feet while they stand or crouch in trees or on man-made structures. When magpies have baby chicks in their nests, the adults will “swoop” at nearby people – flying at their heads – to chase them away. Some people feed magpies by throwing small pieces of meat to them.

They are needed for success in school, especially for college and beyond. Study skills include numerous techniques and skills that help in acquiring and retaining information. Some are assessment tools that help a student see where they need help most. Study skills might include a learner's ability to listen, read, understand, concentrate, remember and organise their learning material, and manage studying time. Learning strategies Time management is an essential skill. Teachers have found a connection between students who can manage their time well, and their GPA (grade point average). The better they manage time, the higher their GPA. Britton and Tesser (1991) found that measuring the time management skills of freshmen was a better indicator of higher GPAs than their SAT scores as seniors. Most students find that by analyzing their use of time, much of it is wasted. Mnemonics may help to remember lists or sequences of information. The name Roy G. Biv is an example of a mnemonic. It is an acronym for the colors of the rainbow in proper sequence: Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo and Violet. They also include rhymes, phrases, poems and associating pictures with information. Mnemonics should be used sparingly as they have some limitations. The SQ3R Method. This is an acronym for survey question, read, recite and review. SQ3R was developed by Francis Robinson in 1941. Students learn to survey the reading materials, not by reading every word, but by getting an overall sense of what it is about. The next step is to form questions. Look at the end of chapters or books to see if there are questions. Read the materials to answer the questions. Next, recite what you have learned out loud."

He was the leader of the Realist movement in 19th-century French painting. Courbet was prepared to try out new ideas and ways of painting. His paintings made social comment on the world around him. Courbet's paintings were an inspiration to many other painters, particularly the French Impressionists and Post-Impressionists. Edouard Manet, Edgar Degas, Vincent van Gogh and Henri Toulouse-Lautrec were all inspired by Gustave Courbet's paintings of people. His landscape paintings were an inspiration to Claude Monet, Seurat, Cezanne and many other painters. Early life Courbet was born in 1819, and was the son of Régis and Sylvie Oudot Courbet in Ornans, Doubs. Courbet's sisters, Zoé, Zélie and Juliette, were his first models for drawing and painting. When Courbet was twenty he went to Paris in 1839, and worked at the studio of two other painters, Steuben and Hesse. He was not happy there, and wanted to work on his own. He studied the works of many great masters, including Goya, Velazquez and Titian. He painted several self-portraits at this time. He often returned home to Ornans to hunt, fish and find inspiration in the countryside and country life. In 1846–1847 Coubet travelled to the Netherlands and Belgium where he studied the paintings of Rembrandt, Franz Hals and Jan Steen who all painted in the 1600s. The paintings by these artists often showed realistic scenes and portraits of everyday life. They showed ordinary people at the table together, dancing, writing, cooking, working at trades and in businesses and in the fields. There were many pictures of soldiers. Courbet decided that he wanted to paint scenes of ordinary life the way that these artists did."

The period saw many changes in fashion, including changes in clothing, architecture, literature, and visual arts. During this period, fashion changed a lot. In the 1800s, you had small silhouettes and pastel colors. In the 1830s, there was very exaggerated fashion. The 1860s are also famous for this along with the 1870s, the 1880s, and the 1890s. But during the early part of the 20th century, fashion was toned down in the sense of exaggeration and playfulness. The main woman who inspired was the Queen of England and Empress of India, Victoria. She was at the peak of royalty and ruled for many years, therefore influencing many trends during the century. By 1907, clothing was increasingly factory-made and often sold in large, fixed price department stores. Custom sewing and home sewing were still significant, but on the decline. New machinery and materials developed clothing in many ways. The introduction of the lock-stitch sewing machine in mid-century simplified home and boutique dressmaking. It made it easy to add trimmings which would be costly if done by hand. Lace machinery made lace at a fraction of the cost of the old hand-made lace. Inventors developed new, cheap, bright dyes like mauveine which replaced the old animal or vegetable dyes."

The word navigation was invented in the 15th century from the Latin word navis which means ""ship"" and is found in other Indo-European languages. Navigation is literally ""art of ship mastery"" but is also used for 'finding one's way'. The Global Positioning System is the main tool for it. Simple navigation One type of navigation was made by the Polynesians and is called Polynesian navigation. Polynesians used different things found all around them to find their way across large areas of open ocean. Other early people also learned how to travel large distances using the natural world. For example: A long time ago (and still used by some people today) people would watch the stars, the sun and the moon. From this they would know where north was. With charts they could find how far from the equator they were. This is called celestial navigation. Until they had accurate clocks they didn't know their Longitude (how far east or west they were) without seeing landmarks. Some types of clouds form over land, and waves can bounce off of a shore and travel out to sea. The time it took to get to a place.

Even though they look like members of the genus Mus, scientists thhink that the African spiny mice may be more closely related to gerbils than to common mice. Spiny mice as exotic pets African spiny mice originated in the deserts of Africa. They are often kept as exotic pets in other parts of the world, particularly Western nations such as the United States. In the pet trade, they are commonly called Egyptian spiny mice or, more simply, spiny mice. Though these animals are like pet mice and rats, the tail of a spiny mouse is much more delicate. The spiny mouse should never be picked up by its tail and should be handled with care to avoid a degloving injury. Housing Because of their desert origin, spiny mice need warm temperatures and should be kept around 80 degrees Fahrenheit. These animals are very social and should always be housed in groups when possible. As spiny mice are prone to obesity (getting too fat), it is important to provide a big space and a complex environment to encourage exercise.

They erupt when pressure has built up, often at regular intervals. There are about a thousand geysers around the world. About half are in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, United States. Causes Geysers are made in special geological conditions. Only a few places on Earth have these conditions. Because of this, geysers are not very common. One place is the Yellowstone National Park, which is the remains of a gigantic volcano. Another is Iceland, which sits on top of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, where new Earth's crust is formed. Geysers are often near active volcanos. This is because the geyser is caused by magma. Surface water usually goes down to about . There, it mixes with hot rocks. The pressurized water begins to boil. When it is pressured enough, hot water and steam burst out of the geyser. Form and function Individual geysers do not last forever, but systems of geysers last as long as the geological situation continues. The oldest individual geysers are only a few thousand years old. Geysers are usually near volcanic areas. As the water boils, the pressure increases. This forces hot steam and water to the surface through the geyser. Geysers are usually made because of three things that are around volcanoes. Great heat A geyser needs a lot of heat . This heat comes from magma. This magma needs to be near the surface of the earth. Geysers need much more heat than is usually found near the earth's surface. This is why they are often around volcanoes or volcanic areas. Water The water that bursts from a geyser must travel underground through deep, high-pressure cracks in the earth's crust."

CP is usually caused by damage done to the brain during early childhood. It is called ""cerebral palsy"" because the part of the brain that is damaged is the cerebrum. CP cannot be cured. It is treated with therapies. CP was first identified by an English surgeon called William Little in 1860. There are several types of cerebral palsy. The most common type is spastic cerebral palsy. Today, 1 in every 400 children in the UK has cerebral palsy. Symptoms People with CP often have trouble standing or walking. They may also be partly paralysed. While the main problem of cerebral palsy is problems with moving, difficulties with having thoughts, learning, feeling, talking and behaviour often come with cerebral palsy.

While the Beatles gained experience performing in Hamburg, Germany, the Remo Four played at American Air Force bases in France. Members of the two bands were friends, and often played at the same places back in Liverpool, or would go to watch each other perform. After the Beatles became famous under Brian Epstein's management, Epstein signed up the Remo Four also. He worked hard to promote the band, but they never achieved massive success as the Beatles had. Epstein paired the Remo Four with a singer he also managed, called Tommy Quickly. They made a series of singles together, but none became hits. Quickly retired from music, and the Remo Four went on to work with other singers, including Billy J. Kramer. They also released an album, titled Smile, on a German record label. George Harrison was invited to record a movie soundtrack in late 1967. Instead of working with the Beatles, he invited the Remo Four to work with him. The movie, Wonderwall, got little exposure, but the soundtrack album, Wonderwall Music, became a minor hit the next year."

It is a personal judgement based on the facts of a situation. Common sense is usually the simplest and most direct account of a situation. It is the knowledge and experience which most people have, or should have. The Cambridge Dictionary defines it as, ""the basic level of practical knowledge and judgment that we all need to help us live in a reasonable and safe way"". ""Common sense"" has at least two philosophical meanings. One is a capability of the mind to perceive things like movement and size. The second is our natural sense for other humans and the community. Both of these refer to a type of basic awareness and ability to judge. Most people are expected to share these things naturally, even if they can not explain why. It is quite possible for common sense to be wrong, and science often explains things in quite a different way from common sense. People lack any common-sense intuition of the universe at subatomic distances, or of speeds approaching that of light. Today it is well known that the Earth travels around the Sun but before the scientific revolution people thought that the Sun going around the Earth was common sense. According to the Simple English Wiktionary “Common sense is something that everybody knows and understands."

The discharge can be different colors. It can be thick or thin. Nipple discharge can come from one breast or both. Nipple discharge in men is not normal. Ninety-seven percent of the time, nipple discharge is not cancer. Sometimes discharge from nipples will get better and not need treatment. Most of the time nipple discharge is not cancer. Once in a while it can be a sign of breast cancer. Newborn babies can have nipple discharge. This is because hormones from the mother cause milk to develop in the baby. This kind of discharge goes away in 2 weeks. Here are some of the reasons for nipple discharge: Rubbing of the nipple from a bra or t-shirt Injury Infection Clogging of the milk ducts Tumors in other places in the body Benign tumor that is not cancer Normal lumpiness in the breast Some herbs, such as anise and fennel Breast abscess Chronic kidney/liver problems Some medications can cause nipple discharge. These medicines are opioids, oral contraceptives, antihypertensives (methyldopa, reserpine, verapamil), antidepressants and antipsychotics. A woman is more likely to have changes in her breasts as she gets older. Some of these changes can be the cause of nipple discharge. A doctor or nurse will often ask a woman to have a examination. Medical tests can find the reason for the nipple discharge. A mammogram and ultrasound are two tests that a doctor might use. The fluid that comes out of the nipple may be collected and tested. Sometimes nipple discharge is treated with an operation. Even after surgery another operation may be needed."

It is at the southeastern end of Cuba (). It is the largest harbour on the south side of the island. It is surrounded by steep hills creating an enclave cut off from its immediate hinterland. History The bay was originally named Guantánamo by the Taíno. Christopher Columbus landed at the location known as Fisherman's Point in 1494, naming it Puerto Grande. On landing, Columbus's crew found Taíno fisherman preparing a feast for the local chieftain. When Spanish settlers took control of the island, the bay became a vital harbor on the south side of the island. The bay has been the focus of military activities for a long time. In the colonial era, British troops tried to land there, during the War of the Jenkin's Ear. That war was between England and Spain. It took place between 1739 and 1742. The troops could land in the bay, and later tried to take the city Santiago de Cuba. As it turned out, this was impossible. So the troops claimed the bay as theirs, and named it Cumberland Harbour. Later they left the island again, because some of their troops had died from tropical diseases. The United States tried to buy the whole island of Cuba. In the Spanish-American war, US troops occupied the bay, because there was a harbour there. The Treaty of Paris, between the United States and Spain ended the war. It gave Cuba its independence from Spain. Spain also gave the territory of Puerto Rico, and the islands of Guam and the Philippines to the United States, amongst others. Cuba, however, came under the political and military infuence of the United States. The US then put presidents and dictators at the head of the Cuban state."

Carlo Gesualdo, known as Gesualdo da Venosa (born probably 8 March 1566; died 8 September 1613), Prince of Venosa and Count of Conza, was an Italian music composer, lutenist and murderer. He lived in the late part of the Renaissance period. He is famous for his beautifully expressive madrigals which are written in a very chromatic style (using lots of sharps and flats). He is also remembered for committing a horrible murder. Life Gesualdo came from an aristocratic family. He was probably born at Venosa, but we know hardly anything about his early life. We know that he was extremely interested in music when he was small and showed very little interest in anything else. He played the lute, harpsichord and guitar. The murders In 1586 Gesualdo married his first cousin, Donna Maria d'Avalos, the daughter of the Marquis of Pescara. Two years later she began to have a love affair with Fabrizio Carafa, the Duke of Andria. For two years her husband knew nothing about her love affair. Then one day he returned unexpectedly to his palace (he may have suspected that something was happening) and found them making love. He murdered them both in their bed. He then left their bodies in front of the palace for everyone to see. In those days in Italy a nobleman could not be arrested and punished. However, someone might have wanted to kill him in revenge, so he ran away to the town of Gesualdo where he had a castle. A lot of people heard about the murders. Famous poets such as Tasso wrote poems about it. Nothing was done to arrest Gesualdo, however."

The word neutrino means a small neutral particle. Physicists study these particles, but they are hard to find because they have a very small chance of interacting with regular matter. (For example, they usually pass through the whole earth without touching any other particles). Neutrinos travel near the speed of light. Neutrinos are very difficult to detect. They are very unlikely to collide (interact) with other particles as they travel through space or through matter. Electrons have an electric charge, but neutrinos do not. This means that neutrinos are unaffected by the electromagnetic force. The first detectors built to find neutrinos observed only 10 or 15 each year. Recent detectors use tanks that contain about a thousand tons of water or other liquid, which lets them detect about 10 to 100 neutrinos per day. Neutrinos are generated in particle accelerators, in the sun, in other stars, and in nuclear reactions such as in nuclear reactors. They are generated whenever there is a nuclear reaction in the form of beta decay. This process starts off with one neutron, and ends with one electron, one proton, and one neutrino. We used to think that neutrinos have no mass, but a few years ago physicists found that they have a very small mass, much lighter than electrons. By finding neutrinos, we can learn about the structure and the history of the universe. Since most of them pass easily through sun, physicists have learned about the reactions in the center of the sun that make the sun's heat, by detecting the neutrinos that come out from the sun's center. The three types of neutrinos are named after the three leptons that have electric charge."

Parks is best known for what she did in her home town of Montgomery, Alabama on December 1, 1955. While she sat in a seat in the middle of the bus, the bus driver told her to move to the back of the bus so a white passenger could take the seat in the front of the bus. During this time, when there were no white seats for white people, black people were told to get up out of their seat. Parks refused to move. She was a member of the local chapter of National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). Like so many others she was tired of being treated as a lower class person because of the color of her skin. She was arrested. This led to the Montgomery bus boycott. The boycott lasted 381 days. This caused a change in the law. After that, black people were able to sit wherever they wanted to on the bus. Her refusal to let others treat her differently was an important symbol in the campaign against racial segregation. Early years Rosa Parks was born in Tuskegee, Alabama, on February 4, 1913.

They are based in London's Barbican Centre, but they often tour to lots of different countries. The LSO started in 1904. Most of the players had been members of Henry Wood's Queen's Hall orchestra. They left that orchestra when Henry Wood made a rule that they were not allowed to send deputies to rehearsals or concerts. The LSO was set up as a self governing organization. This means that the players themselves organize everything: they decide how much they are going to be paid, who can be in the orchestra, etc. The LSO gave its first concert on 9 June 1904 with Hans Richter conducting. He was principal (main) conductor until 1911, when Edward Elgar took over for a year. Some of the world's most famous conductors have conducted the orchestra. Since January 2007 Valery Gergiev has been the LSO's Principal Conductor. André Previn is the Conductor Laureate (Honorary conductor).

The law takes the Post Office Department out of the Cabinet of the President and makes it an independent agency. This agency is the United States Postal Service. Background The Post Office had been struggling due to Congress. Because the department was a part of the government, Congress had to approve most things that happened to it. This made change to the Postal Office Department very slow, and this did not sit well with the Postal Unions. They wanted more change to improve the conditions of the Postal Workers, but Congress was too slow to bring in rapid change. The unions worked with Congress and the president to create a better system. The Postal Reorganization Act was the final product of this work. Details One of the changes was the business goal of the Postal Service. Now that they were an independent agency, they did not receive money from Congress, so they had to work to make money through the selling of stamps and shipping. Another was their new way of choosing the Postmaster General. A Board of Governors is elected by the president, and these people are able to choose the Postmaster General.

The attack was a battle in the U.S. Civil War. The Confederates won the battle. They won because groups of guerillas led by William Quantrill rode into town and shot every man they saw. They killed about 150 people. The guerillas attacked Lawrence because the city supported abolition and because it was a center for the Jayhawkers. The Jayhawkers were free-state militia groups known for attacking plantations in the pro-slavery western counties of Missouri. Background By 1863, there had been a lot of violence in Kansas. This is because people disagreed about whether Kansas should allow slavery or not. In the summer of 1856, the first sacking of Lawrence started a guerrilla war in Kansas that lasted for years. John Brown might be the most famous person involved in the violence of the late 1850s that fought on the abolitionist or Jayhawker side. However, there were many groups on each side that fought during the ""Bleeding Kansas"" period. By the beginning of the American Civil War, Lawrence was already a target for pro-slavery violence. This is because Lawrence was the biggest anti-slavery city in the state. It was also where the Union and Jayhawkers started attacks into Missouri. At first, the town and area around it were very prepared. They reacted strongly to any rumors that pro-slavery people might be coming to Lawrence. However, by the summer of 1863, this never happened, so the people did not fear much, and they forgot about their defenses. Reasons for the attack Revenge for Jayhawker attacks Lawrence was a headquarters for a group of Jayhawkers (sometimes called ""Red Legs""). They had started a campaign in late March 1863."

Many electronic devices like radio, television, radar, wireless LAN, cell phone, and GPS need antennas to do their job. Antennas work both in air and outer space. The word 'antenna' is from Guglielmo Marconi's test with wireless equipment in 1895. For the test, he used a 2.5 meter long pole antenna with a tent pole called ' l'antenna centrale ' in Italian. So his antenna was simply called ' l'antenna '. After that, the word 'antenna' became popular among people and had the meaning it has today. The plural of antenna is either antennas or antennae (U.S. and Canada tends to use antennas more than other places). Types of antennas Each one is made to work for a specific frequency range. The antenna's length or size usually depends on the wavelength (1/frequency) it uses. Different kinds of antenna have different purposes. For example, the isotropic radiator is an imaginary antenna that sends signals equally in all directions. The dipole antenna is simply two wires with one end of each wire connected to the radio and the other end standing free in space. It sends or receives signals in all directions except where the wires are pointing. Some antennas are more directional. Horn is used where high gain is needed, the wavelength is short. Satellite television and radio telescopes mostly use dish antennas."

The popularity of the sport inspired the semi-pro national baseball clubs in the 1860s. Early history The earliest known mention of baseball in the United States was a 1791 Pittsfield, Massachusetts, law banning the playing of the game within of the town meeting house. In 1903, the British sportswriter Henry Chadwick wrote an article saying that baseball came from a British game called rounders. A game which Chadwick had played as a boy in England. But baseball executive Albert Spalding disagreed. Baseball, said Spalding, was basically an American sport and began in America. To decide they agreed to let Abraham G. Mills settle the question by heading a commission. After three years they found that Abner Doubleday had invented the national pastime. In 2004, baseball historian John Thorn discovered the 1791 town ordinance, putting Pittsfield's connection to baseball 48 years before Abner Doubleday accepted invention of the game in 1839 in Cooperstown, New York. This is where the National Baseball Hall of Fame now stands. The Hall of Fame recognized the ordinance as the first known reference to the game and honored the town with a plaque. Another early reference reports that base ball was regularly played on Saturdays in 1823 just outside of New York City in an area that today is Greenwich Village.

It describes how the pollen grains get to the female parts of a plant. Pollen grains, which contain the male gametes, need to get to where the female gamete(s) are. What happens is basically the same as sexual reproduction in animals. Each pollen grain is haploid: it has half of the DNA (genetic information) that is needed to make a new plant. During fertilization this combines with the DNA that is in the egg of the female part and a zygote is formed. In seed plants a seed is started. Ways of pollinating In flowering plants, pollen has to get from one flower to another. There are two main ways that this can happen: by non-living things like wind or water, or by living things such as insects or birds. Maize and the wind Maize (called corn in some parts of the world) is pollinated by wind. The male anthers let go of their pollen and it blows over to a nearby female flower on another corn plant. Most of the flowers are either male or female on a corn plant (monoecious), rather than both sexes in one flower (hermaphrodite). Maize flowers have evolved (changed over time) to use wind for pollination. They do not need pretty petals. The pollen is light so it can blow around, and the ends of the female parts (stigma) are fluffy to catch all the tiny pollen grains. Tomatoes and bees With tomato plants, bees move the pollen from the male parts of one flower (anthers), to the female parts of another flower (stigma). The bee moves between flowers as it collects the nectar that the flowers make."

It is made of custard. It is topped with a thin, brittle crust of caramelized sugar. It may be served cold, warm, or at room temperature. The custard is baked, and then sprinkled with sugar Casa that is caramelized under a broiler or with a kitchen blowtorch. The custard is flavored with vanilla. Other flavorings include chocolate, orange liqueur, fruit, or other. The caramelized sugar crust can be covered with a liqueur and set on fire. The exact origin of crème brûlée is uncertain. France, England, and Spain all claim to be the country where crème brûlée had its origin. The first printed recipe for a dessert called crème brûlée is from the 1691 edition of the French cookbook Le Cuisinier Royal et Bourgeois by Francois Massialot, a cook at the Palace of Versailles. That version was a sweet custard of egg yolks and milk with a burnt sugar crust. It is similar to the modern versions. In the second edition of the book, the dessert is called crème anglaise. At Trinity College, Cambridge the dessert was known as 'burnt cream'. The college crest was burnt into sugar on top of a custard using a hot iron. It may predate Massialot's cookbook with one authority claiming it was first served at Trinity in 1630. Catalans claim their dessert known as crema catalana is the original. It is a rich custard often flavoured with cinnamon and lemon or orange zest topped with carmelized sugar. The Catalan version was first recorded in the 18th century. It is also called Crema de Sant Josep, after Saint Joseph, the husband of the Virgin Mary. In Spain and in many other parts of Europe, Saint Joseph’s Day is celebrated on 19 March."

It was invented by Russian inventor Léon Theremin in October 1920 after the outbreak of the Russian civil war. Its invention grew out of a search for ways to detect movement. It was the first musical instrument to be played without being touched. The control section has two metal antennae to sense the positions of the player's hands. One hand controls the pitch. The other hand controls the volume. To play the theremin, the player moves his hands around the two metal antennas. The electric signals from the theremin are amplified and sent to a loudspeaker. The sound of the theremin is associated with ""alien,"" surreal, and eerie-sounding portamento, glissando, tremolo, and vibrato sounds. It has been used in film soundtracks such as Spellbound, The Lost Weekend, Ed Wood, Mars Attacks! and The Day the Earth Stood Still. The BBC Radiophonic Workshop used the theramin to provide the electronic sounds in demand in the mid-century. Theremins are also used in art music (especially avant-garde and 20th century ""new music"") and in popular music genres such as rock and pop. The Russian Dmitri Shostakovich was one of the first to include parts for the theremin in orchestral pieces, including a use in his score for the 1931 film Odna."

It was written in 1778. It is one of only two true double concertos that Mozart wrote. It is the only piece of music that Mozart wrote for the harp. History Mozart was living in Paris at the time he wrote this concerto. He wrote it for the flute-playing Duke of and his harp-playing daughter Marie. Mozart never liked either instrument. The combination is a difficult one for duo. The work is pleasing and popular however. It is a favorite with harpists because there are so few concertos for harp. The Duke failed to pay Mozart for the concerto. Music The orchestra is a group of strings, two oboes, and two horns. This small group makes the work suitable for an assembly room. The concerto is made of three movements. The opening movement is song-like. According to the All Music Guide to Classical Music, this movement is distinguished by dialogue-like passages for the soloists. The second movement is ""florid"" with the soloists accompanied only by strings. The third movement ""is a lively rondo with a veritable parade of attractive tunes."

He is mentioned in the Books of Kings and the Books of Chronicles. Ahab's reign throughout Israel Ahab son of Omri did ""more evil in the eyes of the Lord than any of those before him"" (1 Kings 16:30), as it is written in the Bible. Many think - and say - that it is probably because of his evil wife, Queen Jezebel, daughter of Ethbaal king of the Sidonians. She was even more sinful than Ahab, and comes out in the Bible, commanding Ahab to do most of the things she wants. She serves the idol Baal and tries to make Ahab and all the Israelites worship it as well. One of Ahab's most famous enemies is an old prophet (a man of God) named Elijah. He continually rebukes Ahab for being so disobeying to the Lord, and when Ahab summoned all the prophets of Baal against Elijah at Mount Carmel, and set two altars for them, Elijah won by calling on God and letting fire come and burn the sacrifice, and the prophets of Baal were immediately killed by the Israelites. Importantly, even here Ahab does nothing, either to stop or help Elijah. The Battle between Ahab and Ben-Hadad Once, there was a quite well-known war between Ben-Hadad king of Aram and King Ahab. Ben-Hadad came and, ""with thirty-two kings with horses and chariots"" (1 Kings 20), he attacked Samaria. He said to King Ahab: ""Your silver and gold are mine, and the best of your wives and children are mine."" This King Ahab agreed with—but after that, Ben-Hadad sent another more demanding command: ""I sent to demand your silver and gold, your wives and children."
