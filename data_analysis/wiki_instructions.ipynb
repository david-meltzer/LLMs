It was first revealed in May 2012, after The Avengers was released. On August 6, 2012, director Joss Whedon announced on Twitter that principal photography was complete.

The Dixiecrats did not agree with civil rights and wanted more states' rights. They were in the Southern United States. In 1948 they left the Democratic Party and formed their party. They met in Birmingham, Alabama and nominated Governor of South Carolina Strom Thurmond for 1948 United States presidential election. In the election they won the U.S states of South Carolina, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Alabama with 39 electoral votes and over 1,000,000 popular votes. The party ended shortly after.\"]"
