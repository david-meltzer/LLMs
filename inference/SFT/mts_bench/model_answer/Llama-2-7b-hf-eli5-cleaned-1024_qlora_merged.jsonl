The part of the brain that interprets smell is called the olfactory bulb. It's just below the frontal lobe, right behind the nose. The smell receptors are on the roof of the mouth, and the back of the nose. When you smell something, the smell molecules enter your nose and go up the nostrils. They then enter the nasal cavity, where they get absorbed by the mucous membrane. The mucous membrane then sends the smell molecules to the olfactory bulb, which interprets the smell. The olfactory bulb then sends the smell information to the frontal lobe, where it is interpreted as a smell. So, to sum it up, smell is like a message sent from your nose to your brain. Your brain then interprets the smell and you know what it is. Your sense of smell is actually the least developed sense. You can't smell nearly as well as you can see, hear, or taste. Your sense of smell is also the most unique. Everyone has a unique sense of smell, and no two people smell the same. This is because every person has a different set of smell receptors. So, even if you smell the same thing, your brain will interpret it differently. The only time that two people will smell the same thing is when they are smelling the exact same thing. But, even then, they may not smell the exact same thing. They may smell different things, but they will both be smelling the same smell. So, smell is a unique sense, and a very interesting one. It's also a very important sense, because it's the only sense that can help you identify a person. If you smell someone's perfume, you can usually identify them by the smell. If you smell someone's perfume, and you're not sure who it is, you can ask them if they smell like that. They will probably say no, but they may say yes.
