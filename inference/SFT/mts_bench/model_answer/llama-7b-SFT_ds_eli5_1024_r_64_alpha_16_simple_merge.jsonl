It is also recommended to be engaging, meaning that the post makes the reader want to go to the place you wrote about. The post should not be a list of things to do, but rather a story about the trip. The story can include things like the best way to get to the place you visited, the food you ate, and the people you met. It is also good to include interesting facts about the place you visited. For example, if you went to Hawaii, you could write about the volcanoes there and how they were formed. You could also talk about the Hawaiian culture and how it is different from the mainland United States. You can also talk about the history of Hawaii and how it became a part of the United States. You can also talk about the different types of animals that live there, like the monk seal. You can also talk about the plants that grow there, like the bougainvillea. You can also talk about the weather and how it changes from day to day. You can also talk about the different landscapes, like the mountains and the beaches.

Try to use the following headings: Introduction (What is a smartphone?) What are the two models? What are their features? How much do they cost? Performance (How well do they run? How long can you use them before they run out of power? How big is their battery?) User experience (How do they feel in your hands? How easy are they to use? How much memory do they have? How well do they take photos? How do they sound? How do they connect to the internet? How well do they handle video and gaming? How do they handle music? How do they handle movies?) Conclusion (Which is better? Why?) Edit: I removed the example, as it is not required. It's up to you to make up your own example. TL;DR: Use a logical structure. Write about features, performance, user experience, and the conclusion. Give an example. Talk about how the example compares to the other model. You don't have to actually have a real-life example, you can make one up. Write about the pros and cons of each model. Talk about how each model is good for different things. Edit: I also removed the bit about \"Why do you want to know?\" because that is not relevant to the question. You are asking a question, you do not need to explain why you are asking the question. That is not how it works. Also, there are a lot of ELI5 posts on this subreddit, and this post does not need to be ELI5. Edit: I removed the \"which is better\" part, as that is also not relevant to the question. You are asking how to write a blog post, not which model is better. If you want to know which model is better, you can ask another question. Edit: I removed the bit about \"How do I write a blog post?\". That is not a question that can be answered in a single post, as it is too broad. It is not like asking \"how do I write a story?\" or \"how do I write a poem?\". You can write a blog post by following a simple structure like this: Introduction (What is a blog post?) What is the topic of the post? What are you going to talk about? What are the main points you want to make? How will you make them? Body (Talk about the main points) Conclusion (Sum up the main points, and end with a call to action) Edit: I removed the bit about \"what is a blog post?\". You do not need to explain what a blog post is, as that is not what you are being asked. You are being asked how to write a blog post. Edit: I removed the bit about \"how long should it be\". The lenh of a blog post is not relevant to the question. You are being asked how to write a blog post, not how long a blog post should be. Edit: I removed the bit about \"what is an outline\". You do not need to explain what an outline is, as that is not what you are being asked. You are being asked how to write a blog post, not what an outline is. Edit: I removed the bit about \"What are the steps for writing a blog post?\". You are being asked how to write a blog post, not how to write a blog post in steps.

What evidence does the author use to support their argument? Is it reliable? Is it relevant? Is it sufficient? The second principle is to look at the logic of the argument. Does the argument make sense? Are the premises true? Are the conclusions logical? The third principle is to look at the assumptions. What assumptions does the author make? Are they reasonable? Are they supported by evidence? The fourth principle is to look at the context. What is the author's purpose? What is the context of the argument? Is the argument relevant to the context? The fifth principle is to look at the consequences. What are the consequences of the argument? Are they good or bad? Are they supported by evidence? Are they logical? Are they reasonable? Are they supported by the context? These are the five key principles in evaluating an argument in analytical writing. By looking at the evidence, logic, assumptions, context, and consequences, you can evaluate an argument and decide whether it is strong or weak. Remember, the stronger the argument, the more likely it is to be true. The weaker the argument, the less likely it is to be true. By using these principles, you can make an informed decision about the truth of an argument. So, the next time you read an argument, remember to look at the evidence, logic, assumptions, context, and consequences. It will help you make a more informed decision. Good luck!
