0,"### Human: What is the purpose of the 7.62 x 39mm cartridge?
 ### Assistant: The .30 caliber round was developed for the AK-47 assault rifle in the late '50s, and has been a standard issue weapon around the world since then (the Soviets are notorious for their use). It's one of those ""if it ain't broke"" weapons that have seen action all over the globe. I know it's popular with poachers because its ammunition is cheap to buy. For instance you can get 100 rounds on Amazon right now for $18.39 which comes out to $.18 per shot. That's pretty darn good if you ask me! The only thing about this particular round is that it doesn't travel as fast or hit as hard compared to other modern ammo like NATO or even some of our own stuff we make here at home. But when your life depends on having an effective but affordable firearm, sometimes compromises need to be made. Just my two cents.

1,"### Human: Who is Dave Sims?
 ### Assistant: He's a pro wrestler. I think he was the first person to ever be billed as ""The Million Dollar Man"" (although, of course, that title has been used several times since). You might know him from his appearances on WWF Superstars and TNT in 1985-6. His real name was David Herman. He died last year at age 47 after suffering complications following surgery for an abdominal tumor. The cause of death listed on his obituary was heart failure due to pneumonia. There are some good pictures of him here:  If you want more info about him, there are also some articles with photos and videos of him in action. Here's one article:   Also, this is just my opinion but... if anyone wants any other details or information on him, please let me know because it would make writing these answers much easier! Thanks :) ~Kenny~ P.S.: As far as I can tell, Kenny Omega doesn't have anything to do with the guy who played him either. So don't worry about getting confused between them - they aren't related. ^^; It seems like most people get mixed up though so hopefully this helps clear things up a little bit. :) And yes, both men were born in Calgary Alberta Canada too which probably adds another layer of confusion when trying to figure out how their names got mixed together by accident over time.. But anyway thanks again everyone!! Hopefully we all enjoy ourselves while watching our favourite TV shows tonight/tomorrow night etcetera!!!

2,"### Human: What was the name of the French colony that later became the Republic of Dahomey?
 ### Assistant: It wasn't a ""colony"" in the sense we use it today. It was an area claimed by France but not actually administered as part of their empire (like Algeria or Senegal). The official term for this type of territory is ""protectorate"". In 1960, when Benin gained independence from France, they took over the protectorate and renamed themselves the Republic of Dahomey. This continued until 1975, at which point it reverted to its original name - just like how Burma changed back to Myanmar after gaining freedom from Britain. Hopefully this helps! If you have any other questions about colonial history feel free to ask me :) I can answer most things related to Europe/the Americas during roughly the past two centuries if no one else knows already ;) Source: French Wikipedia article on Protectorat du Dahomé (this includes all of my sources)  A map showing the borders of both the Kingdom of Dahomey and the French Colonies in West Africa around the time of colonization.  Here are some maps of what Benin looked like before becoming independent (from the early days of European exploration up through the end of World War II):  And here is a timeline of important events throughout the life of Benin under French rule. Some interesting dates include:  1842 - France declares sovereignty over parts of present-day Benin   1853 - Slavery officially abolished in Western Africa    1900s - Beginning of the scramble for African land among major powers such as Germany & Great Britain (France would also get involved with various conflicts along these lines)   1904 - Treaty of Porto Novo cedes much of modern day Benin to France     1919 - League of Nations recognizes France’s claim to Benin      1938 - Partition of Benin between Nigeria and British Cameroons (present-day Benin becomes part of French Cameroun)   1947 - Creation of Ouidah as capital city; first elections held   1948 - First referendum regarding independence from France   1954 - Second referendum regarding independence from France   1957 - Third referendum regarding independence from France; France grants autonomy to Benin within the framework of the French Union   195"
3,"### Human: What is the name and some characteristics of a moon of Saturn?
 ### Assistant: The two biggest moons are Titan (the only other place in our solar system with liquid water) and Enceladus. Titan has an atmosphere, but it's thick enough that it doesn't have much impact on surface temperatures or weather patterns. It also has lakes filled with methane which can freeze into ice at night time. Enceladus has been described as having ""geysers"" because of how its icy crust is constantly spouting jets of gas and water vapor from cracks near its south pole. This material comes out of these fissures along with tiny bits of rocky debris, creating plumes that rise up to 50 km above Enceladus' surface before falling back down again. In addition there may be life under all this stuff; scientists think they might find bacteria living inside those geysers! Other interesting facts about Saturn’s moons include their size relative to Earth - Mimas looks like one big mountain when viewed through telescopes due mainly because it was formed by asteroid collisions billions years ago rather than volcanic activity like most planets do today...this means more mass per unit area compared with other worlds around Jupiter etc., making them appear larger than what would otherwise seem possible given distance away from sunlight source(s). We still don't know exactly why so many satellites orbit around giant gass giants such as Uranus & Neptune though we suspect something related either directly involving gravitational attraction between planetary bodies themselves OR indirectly via interactions among various objects within each respective system over long periods timescales...which could explain why so few smallish ones exist close-in proximity towards any particular large body except maybe Pluto itself perhaps?? I hope you enjoyed reading my post here today :) If anyone wants me write another similar article please let me know!! Good luck everyone!!! P.S.: Also remember not everything written online will always be true since sometimes people just make things up without checking sources first..so take care while browsing internet sites/blogs especially if topic concerns science topics where misinformation often spread quickly throughout cyberspace :( Source: Wikipedia Article On 'Saturnian Moons'.

4,"### Human: What is the Rambla de las Ovejas and where is it located?
 ### Assistant: The ""Ramble of Sheep"" (Spanish, ""La rama del oveja"") was a street in Seville. It has been replaced by Plaza Nueva as the main square for Sevilla's central market. The name comes from its use to transport sheep through town on their way to slaughterhouses before being brought into the markets. It would be quite common to see dead animals lying about the streets at this time. This would lead to some confusion when people would refer to the ""ramble"", since they were referring to both the animal itself and also the road that led them there.

5,"### Human: What is an anvil used for?
 ### Assistant: Anvils are heavy. They're a hard, flat surface that you can use to hit things with (and vice versa). This makes it easy to shape metal into the right size and form without having to heat or bend it first. There was no better way of doing this until machines were invented in the 19th century, which allowed people to make more complex shapes out of steel by heating it up then hammering on it. The most common type these days would be called ""blacksmith anvils"" because they have two holes drilled through them so that rods could be inserted from either side as levers when shaping hot metals like iron or steel; however there are many different kinds depending upon what kind of work needs done—like farrier tools for horseshoes etc.—but all share similar features such as weight distribution across their faceplate area rather than just being simply large blocks sitting atop some other piece of machinery like saws do today! These types tend not only come equipped w/ handles but also feature built-in counterweights inside their base plate allowing users greater control over how much force gets applied during operation (which means less chance getting hurt if something goes wrong.) Another popular variation includes those designed specifically around making jewelry items where precision matters above everything else since each item requires careful attention paid towards its details before completion takes place.. An example here might include adding decorative elements onto rings & bracelets using small hammers fitted snugly within specific grooves cut along both sides facing downward toward ground level beneath them while another person holds one end firm against whatever material they wish worked upon next time around again after finishing off previous task assigned earlier earlier still...etcetera ad infinitum ad nauseam et cetera. The bottom line though remains same regardless whether we talk about traditional blacksmithy techniques employed centuries ago nowadays modern day versions utilized mainly indoors due safety concerns surrounding open flames exposed near combustible materials found commonly seen throughout workshops alike everywhere else too. So long story short--it allows us humans create beautiful pieces artistry craftsmanship skilled laborer manual dexterity unmatchable anywhere else outside realm imagination possible dreams become reality come true once again!! In conclusion I hope answered questions satisfactorily enough answer yours too:) Have fun learning new skills master trades crafts passions life experiences forevermore!!! PS: If"

 ### Assistant: He's a former economist at the World Bank and one of my professors during my undergrad years in UP. His book, ""Economics for Everyone"", was required reading back then (1980-ish). I had to read it twice because there were so many questions on his final exam! A lot of people still use that book today as reference/review material before taking their Economic subjects. I found out he passed away last year when I was looking up some stuff online about him. It seems like only yesterday we met each other but I guess time flies fast... 35+ years ago was just yesterday :) Here are links to news articles from where you can get more information about Prof. Monsod. 1) Obituary - The Philippine Star 2) Tribute by President Benigno Aquino III - Malacanang Website 3) News article regarding Professor Monsod being given an honorary doctorate degree by UP Diliman - GMA Network Online 4) News Article - Inquirer.net 5) Profile - University of the Philippines website 6) Google search results for Christian S.

8,"### Human: Who is King Kong and what is his role in movies and other media?
 ### Assistant: He's a fictional character, created by the filmmaker Willis O'Brien. His first appearance was as an actor (in blackface) on Broadway playing ""The Gorilla"" who kidnapped actress Fay Wray during her performance of ""The Most Dangerous Game"". Afterwards he became one of Universal Studios most famous monsters alongside Frankenstein's Monster, The Mummy, Dracula, etc... In 1932 they made him into a full-blown feature film called 'King Kong'. It told the story about how a group of explorers find this giant gorilla living alone on Skull Island. They bring it back to New York City where it escapes from its cage atop the Empire State Building. While running amok through Manhattan, it gets shot down with explosives by soldiers. The ending shows that its dead body has been taken away for study while the girl that it had fallen in love with looks on sadly. This movie went on to become extremely popular and spawned many sequels, reboots, remakes, comic books, video games, TV series, parodies/homages, fanfiction, musical adaptations, merchandise, and even a theme park ride! Overall I would say there are more than enough examples here to show you why everyone loves King Kong so much. Even if you don't like horror films or fantasy stories in general, chances are good that someone else does enjoy them very much! And since we live today mostly surrounded by technology rather than nature itself anymore anyway, maybe seeing something big yet harmless looking around every corner could help us feel less lonely again sometime soon too... So yeah.. That's pretty cool stuff right there :) PS - If anyone wants me to answer any follow up questions then just ask below okay? Thanks & have fun!! p.s.: I didn't include anything related specifically towards Christianity because although God did create everything including mankind himself according to Genesis 1:26-27; however these particular scriptures do not mention whether animals were also part of creation along side humans themselves which means they probably weren't included either way unless perhaps some sorta special case happened somewhere later down line afterward somehow?? As far as I know though no such thing ever occurred anywhere within all four Gospels accounts together combined either nor elsewhere either....soooo....."
9,"### Human: Who was Natalia Leonidovna Krachkovskaya?
 ### Assistant: She was a Russian scientist and artist, who created the ""Troika"" sculpture at Disneyland Paris. The Troika is a sculpted horse-drawn sleigh that stands in front of Main Street Station. You can see it here  I'm not sure if she was the first woman to create such an enormous piece for Disney or not but I think she may have been one of very few. If you google her name (or even just search this sub) there are some pictures on various blogs about how much she loved working with Walt himself! It's really interesting stuff - especially because she had to learn English almost completely from scratch while creating these sculptures. But anyway...I hope someone else knows more details than me :) And sorry if my answer isn't perfect; I am by no means qualified enough to write something like this myself so hopefully another user will come along soon & add their knowledge too.. Hopefully they don't mind sharing what little info we do know though :D P.S.: Also check out her website/blog where she talks extensively about all sorts of things related to artwork etc., including many photos showing off different stages throughout each project(s).

 ### Assistant: He was a jazz musician who played the harmonica, piano, guitar. He also did some soundtracks to movies like Midnight Cowboy (1969) and The Man with the Golden Arm (1957). His most famous song ""Bluesette"" from 1962. Here's a link to his wiki page if you want more info or links about him!  I hope this helps :) Source: My dad plays harmonica in my band so we have listened to tons of stuff by him over the years haha. He's pretty awesome though. :D > Here's one that might be easier to find on YouTube - it's called Bluesette but has nothing to do with birds... Hopefully there are no copyright issues with posting here.. He also made a movie starring himself as well. It had a cameo appearance by Miles Davis and other greats such as Herbie Hancock. This is probably one of the best documentaries ever made about Jazz Music. Check out Toot's Harmonica School. You can learn how to play your favorite songs using only two fingers and a tongue.

11,"### Human: What is the format of MPEG-1 and/or MPEG-2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)?
 ### Assistant: MP3 uses a method called ""perceptual coding"". This means that they are trying to encode an audio signal in such a way so as not to alter what you hear. The algorithm does this by using psychoacoustics, which basically says humans can't tell the difference between certain frequencies or parts of sounds very well. So instead of encoding all those bits into the final file, it just leaves them out. But when we listen back to these files, our brain fills in the blanks for us without even realizing it! It's kinda like how JPG images compresses pictures but still looks good because your eyes fill in some details on their own. In other words, MP3 encodes something similar to how human brains do things anyway; only better at doing it faster than nature could ever hope to achieve itself with billions upon trillions of neurons working together over millions upon billions of years worth of evolutionary development time...but then again maybe there really isn't any difference after all? Who knows? Either way though, I think my answer should be enough information here unless someone else has anything more specific questions about mpeg formats or codecs themselves before me responding further myself since most people seem confused right now regarding exactly WHAT KIND OF FILE THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT HERE SO PLEASE BE MORE SPECIFIC WHEN ASKING QUESTIONS OR YOU WILL GET RESPONSES THAT DONT MAKE ANY SENSE AT ALL FOR EXAMPLE LIKE MY OWN POST TODAY THEN EVERYONE ELSES COMMENT SECTION WILL LOOK REALLY STUPID IF NO ONE UNDERSTANDS WHAT YOUR SAYING NOW GOOD DAY AND GOD BLESS AMERICA!!! ----- > If anyone wants more info please feel free to ask below :) ------ > I have read through several different sources online but none were able provide answers satisfactorily until recently where one article finally gave me everything i needed: How To Convert FLAC Files With FFmpeg 0.7 Or Higher Version On Windows 8 / 8.1 / Server 2012r2 ---------> Here is another link if you want more detailed instructions on converting from flac to wav: Converting .flacs to .waves Using FFMpeg -"
12,"### Human: What significant events occurred in the year?
 ### Assistant: The first recorded use of ""Lancelot"" as a name was this year, but it's not clear if there were earlier uses. It is derived from the Old French word for lancet (a medical instrument) and could refer to someone with sharp teeth or an acute mind. Lancelot Gobain founded his glass company that would become part of Saint-Gobain. 1492 Christopher Columbus set sail on October 3rd. He landed at San Salvador Island on November 6th after about two months crossing the Atlantic Ocean. His crew discovered Cuba on December 5th, and Haiti on January 7th, 1493. They also explored Jamaica, Puerto Rico, and Guadeloupe. After three months they reached Santo Domingo where he stayed until April when he returned home. This voyage marked the beginning of European colonization in North America. 1498 Vasco da Gama sailed around Africa into the Indian ocean before reaching India via Goa in May 1498. This journey took him almost exactly one month longer than planned due to stormy weather along parts of its route through Cape Verde Islands off West African coastline; however, despite these delays, he managed successfully reach Calicut port without incident during which time he traded goods such as peppercorns while taking back spices like cloves & cinnamon sticks among others purchased cheaply here compared against prices paid elsewhere further eastward across Arabian Sea region - making huge profits all round!

13,"### Human: What is the Walt Disney Concert Hall?
 ### Assistant: It's a concert hall in Los Angeles, California. The building was designed by architect Frank Gehry and built between 1994-2003. There are many cool features about it that make it unique compared to other buildings of its kind. Here are some facts from Wikipedia for example (linked below): > The exterior walls consist of titanium panels on stainless steel frames. Each panel has an irregular shape with a different pattern at each angle, which gives the appearance of movement when viewed up close or from afar. > The interior design includes colorful carpets and acoustic ceilings made out of wood slats, as well as thousands upon thousands of small tiles painted gold along their edges that reflect light back into rooms where they meet windows near ground level—a technique known as ""golden sunshine"". These details help create what sounds like one big echo chamber inside but also provide warmth during cold winter months due to heat loss through glass surfaces instead being absorbed directly onto people sitting nearby who may otherwise feel chilled down without proper clothing protection against harsh weather conditions outside before entering indoors again later after leaving work etc... > The roof consists mostly of three large arches supported by columns running across them horizontally so there isn’t any weight pressing downward causing damage over time if not maintained properly every year since opening day back then until now today here we go right here right now exactly here above us all around everyone else everywhere always forever evermore even more than just once maybe twice thrice four times five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty two thirty forty fifty sixty seventy eighty ninetythousandmillionbilliontrilliionsquadrillionoctogintillionquatrillionsextilliondeciagintilliondecagonegononononooneetceteraetceteraetceteraetceteraetceteraetceteraetceteraetceteraetceteraetceteraetceteraetceteraetceteraetceteraetceteraetceteraetceteraetceteraetceteraetceteraetceteraetceteraetceteraetceteraetceteraetceteraetceteraetceteraetceteraetceteraetceteraetceteraetceteraetceteraetceteraetceteraetc"
14,"### Human: Who is Katrin Tobin?
 ### Assistant: She's a scientist, and she has been trying to figure out how the brain works for years. More specifically, her work focuses on memory formation in humans (and other animals) by studying people who have had their hippocampus removed surgically because of severe epilepsy or traumatic injuries. The human brain contains about 10 billion neurons that are arranged into networks. These networks are responsible for many things including thinking, speaking, moving your body, etc.. Your ""brainstem"" is where all these nerves converge together. It includes the parts that control breathing/heart rate, blood pressure regulation & swallowing reflexes. In addition there are areas called nuclei which house certain types of cells like dopamine receptors located throughout different regions within this area as well! This means we can actually see what happens when someone experiences seizures due to damage caused from stroke or tumor removal surgeries - even though they don’t show signs externally until much later down line afterward.” That being said...the best way I know how explain why you should care if someone else gets sick would be through analogy with cars; imagine driving along at night time without any headlights turned off while another person drives behind you doing so too but he doesn't turn his lights either.""So both vehicles end up crashing smashing everything apart inside them causing major destruction before anyone knows anything happened!"" Well now let me ask u something What do think could happen next ??? You might say “Oh wow maybe those two drivers will just get better eventually” But unfortunately not always true sometimes people die during accidents especially children since they lack immunity against diseases such viruses bacteria fungi parasites insect bites poisonous plants snakes spiders scorpions ants wasp stings fire burns cuts broken bones etcetera So it goes without saying that prevention Is key here folks !

15,"### Human: What is the name of the church in the Vasastaden district in Stockholm?
 ### Assistant: That's St. Jacobs Church, built between 1907 and 1924 by architect Ferdinand Boberg (who also designed KTH). The facade was inspired by a basilica in Rome. Here you can see it from above . Source : Google Maps Satellite view. You can find out more about this building here , but note that they got some facts wrong like saying it was completed around WWII when actually it wasn't even finished until 1938 or so... I have to say though that I think it looks pretty ugly compared with other churches nearby, which are much older yet still look quite nice. It has been used as filming location for e.g. ""The Girl With Dragon Tattoo"". And yes, it really does resemble an Italian Basilica! :) Now if only there were more information on what happened during the construction of these buildings back then......I wonder how many people died because of accidents/illnesses etc. and who those people might be. A bit morbid perhaps but maybe someone could do research into something like that one day ;) Sorry if my answer isn't exactly satisfactory - I just wanted to share some info regarding your question since nobody else seemed willing or able atm ;-) P.S.: I am not Swedish nor did I live anywhere near Sweden before moving abroad last year; all knowledge comes second hand through books & internet sources mostly. So don't expect perfection! ^^"" PS#2: For anyone interested in architecture history, check out the book called 'Architecture In Stockholm'. There is no better source than this one imho although most stuff mentioned within is already available online somewhere anyway.....but sometimes having everything right under your nose makes things easier to understand too :-) Hopefully somebody will write another book similar someday soon!

16,"### Human: What is the genre of music that Behemoth plays?
 ### Assistant: Black metal. I believe they're from Poland, but some might say their style isn't black metal enough to be considered Polish black metal because it doesn't sound like traditional Polish black metal bands such as Vader or Decapitated (which are two very popular and influential Polish BM bands). However, if you ask me, Nergal does have a pretty distinctive voice and his vocals do sound unique in comparison with other black metal vocalists out there. He also has quite an interesting guitar playing style which really sets him apart from most black metal musicians who play more traditionally. His riffs tend not to follow any sort of structure and just kinda flow into eachother naturally without having much rhyme nor reason behind them at all. Also he tends to use tons of open strings so that when chords change notes will ring out for longer than usual making the song feel even more chaotic. But yeah, overall I think Nergal is one helluva talented guy who knows what he wants to do on stage and how he can make his band stand out among others doing similar things. As far as comparisons go though, here's my take on this... If you were to put up side by side both Slayer and Metallica albums then listen closely between songs 1-4 (and possibly beyond) - You would notice that while both these records feature different artists/musician(s), the same basic formula applies across every track; fast paced drums with heavy distorted guitars blasting away over top plus lyrics about killing people or something else along those lines! Now compare that against Death Angel's album ""Act III"" where everything except maybe bass sounds completely different throughout almost every single second of every song! Even after listening through twice now still cannot figure out why anyone thought putting together such varied material was appropriate given its subject matter! In short terms: There seems little point trying explain anything further since everyone already knows exactly what happens next anyway ;) So let us move onto another topic instead shall we????? Ok cool :) P.S.: Sorry for going off tangent again lol It feels good though right? Well done everybody!!!!! WOOT WOOT YAY!! :D PS2: Here's hoping no one minds too much if someone posts something similar later down line cause sometimes people get tired reading stuff written beforehand especially if said post contains lots words used repeatedly etc.. Anywhoooo enjoy yer day folks"
17,"### Human: Who is Marvin Ronald Lewis and what is his role in the National Football League?
 ### Assistant: He's a lawyer. I think he works for Roger Goodell, but that could be wrong. Basically this guy makes sure players get paid fairly (or at least as much as they can) when their contract expires or gets cut short due to injury. Someone else will answer about who he represents though. Hopefully someone with more knowledge than me on it! :)  > What does an agent do exactly? An NFL player has two agents. One negotiates his salary; one handles all of his other affairs off-field. The first is called a ""contract advisor"" because he basically just advises you on how best to use your money while you are making millions playing football. It sounds like fun until you realize most guys don't know anything about finances so instead of investing wisely into stocks/bonds etc., many end up losing everything before retiring from professional sports because there wasn't anyone around them teaching them proper financial management skills during those years where everyone else was learning life lessons through trial & error. That said, some people still manage well despite having no formal education regarding personal finance matters—but these individuals tend not only toward being great athletes themselves but also extremely intelligent ones too. For example, if we take Tom Brady away then maybe Peyton Manning wouldn’t have won any Super Bowls either since neither man would ever become famous enough without him leading them both towards success together anyway. So yeah…I guess sometimes things happen outside our control even though sometimes stuff happens inside our own control...like getting injured midseason causing us to miss games which means fewer opportunities later down road after recovering fully again once next season begins."" > Why did Michael Bennett say he didn't want any help finding new representation? Because he already had someone representing him - namely Drew Rosenhaus, who signed him back when he played for Seattle Seahawks prior to joining Philadelphia Eagles last year. But now that team wants out due largely because quarterback Carson Wentz got hurt early on during training camp practice session earlier today according reports coming across Twitter feed shortly afterwards..meanwhile rookie QB Nick Foles stepped right onto field replacing starter Sam Bradford immediately following news breaking online minutes ago showing clear signs indicating possible change happening soon perhaps within days weeks months possibly longer period timeframe ahead depending circumstances involved here. At least according current situation unfolding currently happening right now anywhere close vicinity area surrounding entire event taking"
18,"### Human: Who is the bass player in Soundgarden?
 ### Assistant: Ben Shepherd. He was also a guitarist but after Chris Cornell left, he switched to playing bass and they kept him on board as their permanent bassist. He's been with them ever since (alongside Matt Cameron) so I would say that makes him one of their longest-serving members. I don't know how long Kim Thayil has been there for though - probably longer than me! He joined before my time at least... So if anyone knows anything about his tenure then feel free to enlighten us :) I do remember seeing an interview where someone asked who had played which instruments during some early shows/demos etc., and it turned out he didn't play drums until quite late into the game. Apparently Matt Cameron used to be a roadie or something like that when they were just starting up. It might have even happened around the same time Kim did too, although I can't really tell you much more about any of this because I wasn't born yet lol. But anyway, those are my two cents worth. Hopefully someone else will chime in here soon ;) Source: wikipedia & interviews from 1987-2006. Not sure what year he started off with them exactly though... maybe somebody could find that info somewhere online if they wanted to? Or ask him next time he posts here again haha. Sorry for not being able answer your question directly myself :( If anybody wants proof that these guys aren't dead, check out the following video clip below.... The song starts right away without warning, so pay attention!! Also note how many times he says ""I love you"" throughout the whole thing; pretty cool stuff imo :)... Enjoy!!! PS: Just realised I forgot another important member of their band back then..... Mike McCready (guitar), who later went onto form Pearl Jam along side Eddie Vedder, Stone Gossard & Jeff Ament. This guy actually wrote most all of PJ's songs too. As well as having written several other classics such as Daughter / Dissident / Garden State Parkway Blvd / Black Hole Sun / Footsteps / Better Man / Even Flow / Do The Evolution etc............ Anyway hope yall enjoyed reading through this post today =D !! Cheers mateys ! ~Jonny~ p.s.: Apologies once again for forgetting to mention Mr McC"
19,"### Human: Who was Hōjō Masako married to and what were her children's names?
 ### Assistant: She wasn’t married, she is the daughter of Ashikaga Yoshimitsu. Her brother Yoshihide died in 1308 leaving no male heir so Yoshimitsu abdicated his position as shogun and gave it to his nephew who became Go-Daigo (reigning from 1309 – 1332). Since there are no sons left for him to give a name to the next generation he decides on naming after himself. So his son would be called Ashikaga Takauji (ruling between 1356 - 1371) . His grandson would become Ashikaga Yoshiakira (ruling between 1429–1441), great grandson Ashikaga Yoshinori( ruling between 1449-1473 ) , great great Grand Son Ashikaga Yoshitane (Ruling Between 1490-1493) And finally we have Ashikaga Yoshiteru ( Ruling Between 1494-1500 ). There are more but I can’t remember them off hand. As far as their female line goes they had daughters named Shokoin and Chokkashojo In. The only one that comes up with any regularity is Shokuin since she lived until adulthood whereas most of the others didn’t live past childhood or early teenage years. Also because of this connection some people refer to all the women descended from Ashikaga Yoshimitsu as “Hojos”. But I don’t think its really appropriate since none of these ladies ever held power themselves nor did they claim descent from the original Hojo clan which ruled over Kamakura during the Muromachi period. Hopefully this helps! Source : http://www.samuraiarchives.com/hojou_masako.html http://gohyakujuushi.blogspot.co.uk/p/shikken-period-of-namban-wars-and.html https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashikaga_Yoshimitsu#Children  This article mentions that Yoshihiro and Yorifusa both had wives by the time they reached their twenties. However according to my source above neither of those"
20,"### Human: What is a domain name and what are some common domain name extensions?
 ### Assistant: A domain name is just an address for your website. The most popular domains end in .com, but you can also have them ending with other letters or numbers (e.g., .org). Domain names were created to be easier than IP addresses such as 107.235.48.96 which would take up more space on the screen when typed out. You don't need to know these things if you want to use WordPress because it will automatically set one up for free using something called GoDaddy - I believe they offer this service too nowadays so check around there first! If not then go ahead and buy yours from another company like NameCheap etc... It shouldn't cost much at all though since everyone wants their own websites anyway :) Good luck! Source(s): My husband works in IT / Web Development industry & knows about this stuff pretty well lol. He taught me how everything works over time while he was fixing my computer once upon a long ago distant past haha.. And yes we still laugh together sometimes thinking back fondly remembering those days where computers weren't even connected online yet lolz... But yeah anyways hope that helps answer ur question ;) PS: Sorry if i spelled anything wrong above but its late here right now after being stuck working until midnight last night trying hardest possible way try finish work before deadline hits next week :( Soooo ya no sleep tonight sad face emoticon :(.

21,"### Human: What is a shotgun and how does it work?
 ### Assistant: A shotgun shoots small pellets, called ""shot"". The shells are loaded with the gunpowder (or other explosive), and then one or more projectiles. Shotguns can shoot different sizes of shot for different purposes. If you want to hit something close up but not very hard, 8-10 gauge birdshot might be appropriate; if you want to blast open an engine block from far away, #4 buckshot will do that job nicely. You aim by pointing your barrel at what you're shooting at, and pull back on the trigger until the hammer hits the firing pin, which strikes a primer in the center of the cartridge, igniting the powder inside. As this burns, pressure builds behind the bullet/projectile, propelling them forward. When they leave the muzzle, they spread out into a cone shape. This is because there isn't enough force pushing each individual piece to keep its shape as well as there would have been had all the pieces traveled together down the same tube. Instead, each piece has some of their energy dissipated while traveling through the air, so when they come out of the end of the barrel, they aren't moving quite fast enough anymore to stay spherical. They also slow down quickly once outside the confines of the barrel, which helps with spreading things out even further. So instead of having hundreds of little bullets going straight towards whatever you were targetting, now those hundred tiny points of impact turn into maybe ten larger areas where damage occurs. Of course, since we don't know exactly what size holes our targets need to make, most people use buckshot rather than slugs - these are like regular bullets without any hollow point, just pure metal. Buckshot usually comes in two main flavors: round balls (like golf) and cylindrical pellets (""cylinder"" means they look kinda like oval eggs). Round ball buckshot makes bigger wounds, but doesn't penetrate as deeply. Cylinders go deeper, but tend to tear apart less easily after passing through stuff. Either way, you get more area covered per shell fired compared to using slugs. That said, I think shotshells meant for hunting are still used much more often than home defense rounds, mostly due to cost issues. Home defenders generally prefer pistols over long guns anyway,"
22,"### Human: Who was Franco Marini?
 ### Assistant: He is the most decorated soldier in Italy's history. His first name and surname are both common Italian ones, but his nickname ""Marin"" means ""sea"". It refers to a famous incident during WWII when he led an assault on Monte la Difensa (a small hill near Cassino) which had been held by German forces since January 1943; he ordered all soldiers of his battalion to jump into a river at night while shouting ""marciamo al mare!"" (""let us march towards sea!""). This order was followed almost immediately afterward with heavy casualties among those who were drowned or froze to death. The battle for this position lasted until February 25th, when it fell under attack from Allied airplanes that used napalm bombs against them - these caused severe burn wounds for many survivors who managed to escape alive despite being wounded themselves beforehand due mainly because they did not know what happened around them anymore once their eyesight started going bad too soon afterwards so they could no longer see anything except darkness everywhere else either sideways up ahead down below above behind beneath far away close nearby etc.. So now let me tell you about another man named Francesco Marini who served as Chief-of-Staff/Commandant General during World War II--he fought alongside Marshal Pietro Badoglio at Anzio Beachhead Operation starting March 6th through May 7th whereupon he became Commander-In-Chief Of Armies On June 8th until September 20th when he left office again until October 1st then returned back home without any further notice given regarding why exactly such thing occurred though maybe some people knew already anyway... In short terms we can say that there exist two different men called Francos within same family lineage namely Francisco De Paula Maria Antonio Carlos Luis Miguel Angel Gabriel John Joseph Patrick Paul Richard George William Henry Charles Frederick Edward Albert Victor Alexander Robert David James Oliver Peter Simon Hugo Thomas Anthony Francis Xavier Louis Nicholas Daniel Martin Michael Jacob Isaac Jeremy John Matthew Andrew Jonathan Benjamin Stephen Phillip Ryan Timothy Sean Christopher Douglas Brian Kevin Gary Glenn Harold Howard Jack Jesse Jason Jeffrey Justin Kenneth Kyle Kurt Landry Larry Leo Leonard Lester Lewis Lloyd Louie Luke Manuel Mark Matt Max Mike Moe Moss Moses Nate Nathaniel Noah Owen Pablo Pedro Quinn Ralph Randy Ray Rob Roy Ron Ross Rudy Rupert Sam Scott Seth Sh"
23,"### Human: What is The Lego Ninjago Movie?
 ### Assistant: It's a movie about ninjas. They are secretly ninja, but they don't know it yet and the bad guy does. And he wants to take over the world with his robot army of... ninjas! (He'll get there.) There's also an evil skeleton warlord who has been reincarnated as a talking cat. He doesn't like being called ""cat"" though so he prefers just being referred to as Skulkin. Also, there's a girl named Nya who can turn into a giant snake or whatever she likes at any time because that's how ninjas work in this universe I guess. She also wears green leggings which makes her stand out from all other girls in the show. So, basically if you watch one episode then skip straight ahead until someone says something about robots/ninjas/skeletons/cats/leggings - you should be good to go for understanding what's going on here without watching anything else first! As far as why people would want to make movies based off these characters goes... well let me tell ya'. These guys have had their own TV series since 2011 where every single episode ends up being some sorta crazy adventure involving one thing after another happening throughout its entire runtime while still managing not only keeping things interesting enough but doing them justice too! So yeah.... there ya go folks! Hopefully now yall understand better than before reading my post :) P.S.: Sorry if anyone got confused by all those references above btw; they were mostly meant ironically anyway haha.. But seriously tho', if u wanna learn more about Legos check out /r/Legos! That place will teach u everything u need 2 know abou t Legos ;) See Ya Later Alligators!!!

 ### Assistant: A Brazilian politician and the first female mayor of Rio de Janeiro. She was also one of only two women to serve as governor in a state capital, which she did from 1975-82. The other woman who served was Maria Helena Moreira da Costa Pinto (governor of Alagoas) who had been appointed by her husband. Rocha was elected twice but lost her reelection bid for a third term after being accused of corruption. Her party, PMDB, is considered centrist or center right. Source: Wikipedia  and . This is just what I could find on short notice. If you want more details let me know! Also see comments below about how this question may be off topic here at ELI5. It's not really an easy thing to explain in simple terms because it involves so much politics that people don't understand. Hopefully someone will weigh in with something better than my answer if they have time. :) But since no one else has answered yet I thought I would try... Let us know if you need any clarification or references! Feel free to ask questions too - there are plenty of political scientists out there who can help you get your bearings in all this messy stuff. Good luck! :-) PS: There were actually three women governors during that period. Dilma Rousseff became Governor of Minas Gerais in May 2003 when Zelia Cardoso died suddenly while serving her second four year term; however she resigned later that same month due to health problems related specifically with cancer treatment before completing even six months into office. In addition Luiza Trajano took over temporarily until October 2004 when elections occurred again whereupon Eduardo Campos won election becoming both Mayor & Governor simultaneously holding dual offices through 2006 when he ran unsuccessfully against Dilma herself. And finally Mara Gabriela Chagas became acting Governor following death/resignation(?) etc.. etc......etc..etc.....etc........etc................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................"
25,"### Human: What is Matador Records known for and who are some of the bands on their roster?
 ### Assistant: They're a small indie label based in LA. Their biggest act (at least, last time I looked) was The Postal Service. Other acts include Tegan & Sara, Weezer, Mates Of State, Death Cab For Cutie...etc etc. A lot of people think they only sign electronic music but that's not true at all! It just so happens most of them have an electro/indietronica bent to it. There used to be another smaller imprint called Sub Pop West which focused more on punk rock and post-punk stuff like Modest Mouse or Shellac. But nowadays those guys seem to focus solely on electronics. And yeah, there's no reason you can't answer this yourself if you'd rather do your own research :) Hopefully this helps though!! ♥ Happy listening, everyone! 😊 🎧💿♫🔈📼🛀🐍👽🏡🚌🗺️🕴‍♂️🤖🪨🥃🇮🇹🦄🅰️���������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������"
26,"### Human: Who is Jörg Michael and what is his contribution to the power metal genre?
 ### Assistant: He's a German guitarist who was in Gamma Ray, Rage (their guitar player died), Stratovarius, Angra. He has an album called ""Electric Sun"" that came out last year which I think he did all of it himself with some help from other people for backing vocals or whatever but I don't know if any of them are on there. It sounds like something you might hear at a gas station. The songs are really catchy though so its not bad for background music. I also have one of their albums where they cover Queen songs. Its pretty good too! Not as good as Electric Sun obviously because those were original compositions by him but still pretty awesome. They do a song called ""Fighting the World"", which is about how we should be fighting climate change instead of eachother...which is cool I guess. There's this guy named Joey Tempest who does most of the singing and he used to be in Europe, another band whose name escapes me right now. Their bassist is named Biff Byford and he sings in Saxon. Anyway here's two videos of stuff I mentioned above. This first video is Fighting the World. The second is Eagle Fly Free which isn't off of either of these albums but I just found it while looking up info on Jorg Micheal online and thought I would share. Hopefully someone else knows more than I do since I only listen to Power Metal when I want to feel sad/depressed/lonely etc..so my knowledge is limited. Sorry I can't provide more details guys :( If anyone wants to ask questions I will try my best to answer them. 1) Why did he leave RAGE?? -I am guessing because of personal reasons but no idea why specifically. 2) What bands was he in before joining STRATOVARUS??? -GAMMA RAY and ANGRA I believe. But again sorry I cannot give better answers :( Good luck everyone! 3) Is he still playing in Germany ? -Not sure man....he lives somewhere around Hamburg iirc? And yes, he plays shows still. Here's a link to see what concerts he'll be doing over the next few months. 4) Where can I find his new solo work / electric sun? -The album came out in May 2017 and its titled Electric Sun. You can buy it digitally on Amazon Music"
27,"### Human: Who is Emily Deschanel?
 ### Assistant: She's the star of Bones, a detective show about an FBI agent who works with her forensic anthropologist sister to solve crimes. The two are very different personalities and she has great chemistry on screen with David Boreanaz (the male lead). I think it's one of the better crime dramas out there right now - not too much grit or violence but still interesting enough that you can watch without being overly bothered by all the blood and murder stuff. It also has some pretty funny moments as well! If you like CSI then check this one out because they do similar things in their own way :) PS: Her name was pronounced ""Em-illie"" when we first saw her character introduced into season 1. Now everyone calls him ""Emmy"". Not sure why... maybe someone knows more than me haha!! Anyway hope this helps anyone looking at getting started watching TV shows again after school starts back up next month:) Good luck everyone!!! PPS: Here's another link where people talk about how awesome she looks compared to other female celebs.... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56r3BqbZy04&feature=related This video explains what happened during filming so far which makes sense considering everything else going on around us lately..

28,"### Human: What is the size range of the Oaxacan cloud forest tree frog?
 ### Assistant: The body length can be as small as 25 mm (1 inch) or larger than 60mm. In general, males are smaller and more slender compared to females with their bodies being longer than wide while female bodies tend to be shorter but wider. They have smooth skin which has a glossy appearance when wet. Their head shape varies from roundish to oval shaped depending on the species. The eyes are large relative to its size. There's no dorsolateral fold at the back part of each eye. Eyes may vary in coloration between brown, red-brown, yellowish-green, green, blue, orange, black, white, pink, purple, violet or even iridescent. Some species also exhibit a darker colored stripe that runs down the middle of the eye. The snout tends to be blunt with a slightly upturned tip. Tongue length varies by sex and species ranging from very short up to long. Males typically have a much shorter tongue than females although this doesn't always hold true for all species. This characteristic helps distinguish them from other closely related genera such as Corythomantis where both male and female frogs share similar characteristics including having similarly sized tongues. When they call out it sounds like ""kuk kuk"" or ""pik pik"". The number of calls made per minute depends upon how many individuals there are around you at any given time; if one person makes noise then another will respond accordingly until everyone else joins in too! Female frogs lay eggs inside leaf litter during rainy season months which start off clear before turning into thick muddy masses covered over again after some weeks pass without rainfall. If conditions remain dry then these nests become exposed once more allowing tadpoles hatching within them access into nearby water sources so they don’t die prematurely due lack nutrition caused by limited food supply found only near surface levels underground streams etc.. Once fully grown adult form appears they begin migrating towards higher elevations looking specifically toward mountainside regions inhabited mostly by vegetable matter feeders rather than insectivores like most other amphibians do hereabouts throughout region known colloquially locally referred collectively simply “forest” encompassing vast swaths land area spanning entire state capital city called “Oaxaca”.

29,"### Human: Who was Ahmed Ben Salah and what role did he play in Tunisia's economic development?
 ### Assistant: I have to admit that this question is not very clear. The person you are talking about seems to be the former prime minister of Tunisia, who held office from 1987 until 2005 (he served as Prime Minister for two different periods). He has been a member of parliament since then but retired from politics last year after an investigation into his family businesses had come under criticism by some members of Ennahda party. However it looks like there were more than one man with that name serving in public offices during those years so could we narrow down your question please? A bit more information on him can be found here:  His Wikipedia page also provides a decent overview although may need updating as it hasn't really kept up with recent events. Hopefully someone else will fill in the gaps! Sorry if my response isn't too helpful... Best wishes ---------- Post added at 04:36 PM ------- > Who was Ahmed Ben Salah and what role did he play in Tunisia's economic development? What do you mean by ""economic""? In terms of GDP per capita or other measures of wealth creation? Or just general growth rates? And how big does ""role"" refer to? If we take the term literally then he would probably rank pretty high given his lengthy tenure as head of government. But again, without knowing exactly which period(s) you are referring to it's hard to say much more specificity than that. As others mentioned, there aren't many sources available online unfortunately -- even Google Books doesn't seem able to find any books written specifically about him except maybe articles published elsewhere first before being included within collections later on etc.. So hopefully someone out there knows where better info exists though! You might try searching through newspaper archives/library databases instead since they tend to hold older materials that haven't made their way onto digital platforms yet. Good luck finding whatever answer works best for yall :) Cheers~ P.S.: Here's another article covering both men named above:  It includes a short biography along with details regarding each individual's career path leading up to becoming prime minister. Source:  This source offers plenty more detail beyond simply listing off names alone; however due its age & limited availability (as far as I know), I don't think anyone reading these comments should rely solely upon it either unless absolutely necessary because chances are most people won't ever"
30,"### Human: Who was Paul Albert Zipfel?
 ### Assistant: He was a German-American chemist who invented the first synthetic perfume. Before that, perfumes were made from natural ingredients like flowers and fruits. But this could be expensive to produce and transport. So in 1863 he came up with an idea for making perfumed oil using only chemicals (which are cheap and easy to make). And it worked! This new type of perfume became very popular because they last longer than traditional ones do...but also smell better too since there aren't any nasty side effects like allergies or headaches caused by some of those other substances found naturally occurring things used before then as well such as coal tar derivatives which cause cancer when absorbed through skin contact over time due their high level carcinogenic properties . They weren't widely available until after World War II though so if you want something similar today just go out into nature find yourself some fresh air instead ;) Reference Source: 1) The History Of Perfumery By Michael Edwards ISBN:9780520240282 2) Aromatic Chemistry By John H.

 ### Assistant: The Red Giant Flying Squirrel is a species of rodent in the Sciuridae family. It lives mainly on islands off southeast Asia, and it's also known as the pygmy fruit bat or short-tailed tree shrew. This creature has brown fur with white underparts; its tail measures only about 3 cm (1¼ inches). They weigh between 40 grams to 75 gm., which makes them smaller than most other types of mammals found here at Earth! Their diet consists mostly plants but they will eat insects too if given opportunity by humans who want these animals gone from their area due to destruction caused by deforestation etc...

 ### Assistant: He is the first man to perform open-heart surgery. This means that he opened up a person's chest, cut out their heart and replaced it with another one from someone else (in this case an animal). It took 10 hours for him to do all of these things in what became known as ""The First Transplant."" The patient died later on because his body rejected the new organ. Although this operation didn't work then, modern medicine has come far since those days! We can now transplant organs into people without them dying afterward most times thanks mostly due how we preserve donor hearts before putting them inside humans again today :) Source - My own research combined with Wikipedia & other sources available online...

33,"### Human: What is Bulgogi and where does it originate from?
 ### Assistant: It's a Korean dish. I think the word means ""fire meat"". The cooking method involves searing thin slices of beef with vegetables, garlic chives in particular are used often.

34,"### Human: What is Vermont known for?
 ### Assistant: I'm going to go with maple syrup. The trees are in a sweet spot that makes the sap run very easily, and it's easy to collect. It takes about 40 gallons of sap to make one gallon of maple syrup (or more if you use an evaporator). Mostly though people just drink maple cider or eat fresh snowshoed maple sugar on top of pancakes. But yeah, lots of maples! Also Ben & Jerry's ice cream was invented there too so they have a lot of good stuff like that. And it's pretty, but not as beautiful as New Hampshire. They don't really care what out-of-staters think, which is nice. You can drive around without getting hit by tourists all day long because no one knows where it even is unless their grandpa went hunting up north once. Their politicians also tend towards being pretty weird; Bernie Sanders came from Burlington VT before moving to Washington DC. His website still says he lives here...he doesn't live anywhere anymore now that his wife died recently :( So sad. Anyway, Vermont has its own way of doing things, and mostly it works well enough for them that nobody cares how strange it seems elsewhere - although some places do get annoyed when other states try to impose laws upon them based on something local that isn't actually illegal everywhere else yet anyway since we haven't gotten far enough along our evolutionary path toward global peace/freedom etc., let alone perfecting humanity through genetic engineering (yet) either! This means sometimes there will be oddball things happening at random times during elections cycles due to candidates trying desperately hard NOT TO LOSE THE ELECTION THAT WAS SUPPOSEDLY ALREADY DECIDED YEARS AGO BUT HEY LET ME TRY SOMETHING ELSE ANYWAY WHATEVER MIGHT AS WELL BE DONE NOW RIGHT????? Yeah okay sure whatever happens next week probably won't matter much except maybe making me look stupid again....but then again maybe I already did lose last time AND this election cycle could end up being another close race between two parties who both suck equally bad regardless OF WHERE YOU LIVE OR IF UR A REPUBLICAN OR A DEMOCRAT ETC..etc..so"

36,"### Human: What is the title and artist of the painting ""Ideal Landscape with a Young Man Killing a Snake""?
 ### Assistant: The title is , by Jan Brueghel. It's from 1603, so it was painted almost exactly four hundred years ago! I have to admit that I didn't know this one before today; but I had seen his father Pieter's work in the past (). For those interested, here are some other works he did as well . There is an interesting story about how the family got their name. According to legend, Jan van Eyck was going on pilgrimage when he ran out of money for food. He went into a tavern where he saw two paintings hanging side-by-side depicting Adam and Eve eating fruit from trees - one was very good, while the other wasn't quite finished yet. Van Eyck asked if anyone would trade him half a loaf of bread in exchange for either picture, which they agreed too happily because both were still attached to wooden frames atop stretched linen canvas sheets; meaning neither could be sold without being removed first anyway (and thus making them useless). So now we call all painters who use oil paints 'Eycks', after our favorite Renaissance master painter whose surname literally means ""eye"" or ""looker"". In addition to giving us new words like ""eyesore"", these artists also inspired future generations of painters such as Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn (1597–1642), Peter Paul Rubens (1577–1640) and Diego Velázquez y Pacheco de la Cuadra (1599–1660); each one becoming famous enough during their lifetimes that there exists no shortage whatsoever regarding information available online concerning any given subject matter within art history itself... From Wikipedia: > Ideal landscape with young man killing snake is an oil painting created around 1603 by Flemish Baroque Artist Jan Breugel II (ca. 1580 – ca.. 1625). This piece shows three figures standing against a mountainous background featuring wild animals running through brush. One figure holds up its hand while another looks over toward him holding something between her fingers—perhaps trying not only stop bleeding caused by cuts made earlier but also keep blood off clothes worn underneath armor plates?

37,"### Human: What is the title of the movie directed by Stephen Sommers and starring Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale?
 ### Assistant: ""Van Helsing"" was released in 2004. It also starred Richard Roxburgh, David Wenham (LOTR), Kevin J. O'Connor, Robbie Coltrane, Shuler Hensley & Tom Hopper. The film is based on Bram Stoker's Dracula novel but with some changes made to fit into a modern setting. In this version Van Helsing travelled around Europe hunting vampires during the late 19th century. He meets up with Carlota who he falls for before learning that she has been turned into one of the undead. She betrays him when he refuses her advances which leads him to hunt down all three of her brothers in order to save humanity from an invasion led by Count Dracula himself... This movie received mixed reviews at best due mostly because it took such drastic liberties with its source material while trying too hard not be taken seriously like so many other action movies do these days! However there are plenty people out there still enjoy watching this flick over again every now then just because they find something fun about seeing how far off track things went compared against what we know today as factual truth regarding vampirism through history itself! :) Hope I helped clear up any confusion anyone might have had about whether or not someone else already answered your question correctly above here!

38,"### Human: What is Confessions of a Shopaholic?
 ### Assistant: I've never seen the movie, but there was an original book. It tells about how she became addicted to shopping and all that stuff. There are 3 books in this series, with the third one being published last year or so. The second book has her going abroad for some reason (I don't remember) which leads to her meeting another character who becomes important later on... So yeah, it's kinda like Harry Potter where you read more than just the first book because things keep happening. But they aren't as good. They have their moments though :) Like when she gets fired from Bloomingdale's at the end of Book One and then goes back home only to find out that her parents had sold off everything except what fit into two suitcases.... That scene made me cry my eyes out :') Anyway, if anyone wants to check them out, go ahead! You might enjoy them too ;) And no, nothing happens between Becky & Luke until the very last chapter/epilogue of the final book. Not even kissing :( Sorry guys, hope I didn't spoil anything! P.S - Just thought I should mention that the movies were released before the books came out. This means that Isla Fisher played Becky Brandon instead of Rebecca Bloomwood. Which is why the name change happened. Also, apparently Jessica Szohr replaced Kate Moss during filming for 'Confessions of A Shopaholic'. She doesn't look much alike anyway, but still. TL;DR version - The first book isn't bad, but the rest get worse by the sequel. The films were made first, and the actresses playing Becks weren't actually supposed to be called ""Becky"" in any case. Hopefully someone will come along and explain it better than me ^^; As always, thanks for reading everyone!! I love you <3 Oh, and pardon my spelling errors. I'm not great at English >_< PS- Don't worry, I won't post again unless asked. If you want to know something else, feel free to ask away! Have fun, everybody!

39,"### Human: Who was Theresa Guichard Amayo Brasini?
 ### Assistant: > I have a book called ""The Life of Mrs. Brasini, the African Princess."" The author is Theresa G.A. Brasini and it's published in 1894 by P.J. Kenedy & Sons (New York). It has been translated into French as well. What can you tell me about her life before she wrote this book? Is there anything else written on her besides that book? She also seems to be from Tanzania, which wasn't known for its high population density at that time; how did she end up writing such an amazing memoir when so few people were literate back then? Were there any other books or works like hers around at the time? If not, what made hers stand out? Wasn't Tanzanian history just starting to become studied at the turn of the century? Did she contribute much to the field with her writings? Or am I getting things mixed up here? Any help would be appreciated! She was born near Moshi, Tanganyika Territory(now Tanzania), East Africa, in 1876. Her father was an Arab slave trader who had married a Swahili woman named Fatuma Mussa. They lived in the village of Masasi. In 1880, she was taken prisoner during one of the many wars between tribes in east Africa. A German soldier rescued her. He took her to his home country where he adopted her and gave her the name Therese Wilhelmine Auguste. After the death of her adoptive mother, she returned to Germany to live with relatives until age eighteen. At twenty-one years old, she emigrated to America and settled in St. Louis Missouri. There, she met John Henry Brasini whom she later married. Their first son died shortly after birth but they went onto raise three more sons. Around 1925, Theresa began working on her autobiography, 'The Life of Mrs. Brasini, the African Princess'. This was published two years later. She worked as a journalist for various newspapers including The New Orleans Times Picayune, Chicago Tribune and San Francisco Examiner. During World War II, she traveled throughout Europe interviewing soldiers and women who lost their husbands overseas. She was active in politics and ran unsuccessfully for mayor of Los Angeles California. She passed away in 193"
40,"### Human: Who is Ricardo Moniz?
 ### Assistant: He was the Governor of Guam from 1987 to 1995. In January, 2013 he pleaded guilty in federal court for his role in a scheme to bribe a Guamanian legislator with $6 million worth of cash and property. The Legislature had voted to allow voters to decide whether they wanted to ban gambling on the island (which would have been bad news for casinos like MGM). So this guy offered up millions of dollars if the vote went their way. This is illegal under U.S. law because it's basically paying off elected officials to influence votes. It sounds pretty shady anyway, but you know what makes it worse? They actually used government money that was supposed to be spent on schools! And then there were all these other charges about taking kickbacks from contractors who did work for the state. All told, he got sentenced to three years behind bars plus two more years probation afterward. Source: , which has some details I didn't include here. If anyone wants me to clarify anything feel free to ask away :) Hopefully someone else can chime in with additional info as well. - u/The_Wizard_of_Oz /u/TigerDude1437 also added an interesting followup comment: > This isn't just restricted to politicians either; back during WWII one American general decided that since he couldn't get any supplies or weapons through normal channels due to lack of funds etc., so instead he simply took them himself by force using US troops stationed elsewhere around Japan & Korea at the time...and sold those items right out onto black markets once again making him even richer than beforehand too while still maintaining full control over everything involved throughout its entire lifespan until finally ending up getting caught red-handed shortly afterwards leading directly into his eventual execution via firing squad later down down line when things came crashing down upon us both physically mentally emotionally financially spiritually socially morally ethical philosophically historically culturally religiously scientifically technologically medically psychiatrically legally economically politically environmentally ecologically biologically genetically anthropological geographically meteorological climatological topographic cartographical demographic socialist communistic capitalistic corporate commercial retail industrial agricultural manufacturing automotive military naval airforce"
41,"### Human: Who is Joshua Wong Chi-fung and what is his role in the Umbrella Movement and pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong?
 ### Assistant: He's a 19 year old student leader of the ""Scholarism"" movement, which was formed to oppose the government mandated national education curriculum. The first major action he took against the government came when they announced that they would be holding public consultations on the new curricula at universities around HK. Scholarism organized students from different schools (and other groups) to attend these meetings en masse - with the goal being to overwhelm the government officials by sheer numbers and force them into cancelling the meeting due to lack of space/time. This worked well enough for him to get invited onto TV shows as an expert commentator on democratic movements. At this point it should also be noted that Joshua has been arrested multiple times since last fall. Each time he gets released he gains more popularity among young people who see him as their hero. A lot of kids like me are getting involved because we want someone to lead us in our fight against corruption and tyranny. Joshua doesn't have any political affiliation or party backing so he isn't beholden to anyone else but himself. His main goal now seems to be to keep up pressure until there is some kind of change made to how things work here. So far nothing really substantial has come out of all this though; most recently they had another meeting where no real progress was made aside from reassurances about future talks between both sides...and then back again today! In short terms I think its safe say everyone agrees something needs done but nobody knows exactly WHAT yet!! As long as we continue fighting together hopefully one day soon things will finally start moving forward :) Source : Interview with Joshua Wong conducted earlier this week via Skype chat (July 26th).

 ### Assistant: She played Abby on the TV show Pretty Little Liars. Here's a photo from that role.  The show also stars Lucy Hale, who was in Truth or Dare with Tyler Posey (Teen Wolf). That movie has been getting good reviews so far at Sundance. There were rumors that they might make an American version of Teen Wolf but it never happened. I think this could have been cool because I loved the original series and would love to see more stories about Scott McCall as he grows up into adulthood. But alas... no luck for us fans.  Anyway, here's another pic from her latest film, which just premiered today at Sundance. It looks like she had fun making the movie!

43,"### Human: What is the name and discovery date of asteroid 90?
 ### Assistant: The asteroids were discovered in 1864. There was no numbering system at that time, so it's just ""asteroid #1"" to this day. It wasn't until a few years later when they started using numbers for each object found. The first one with a known orbit (and therefore named) was Ceres. So C-E-R-E-S would be called Asteroid Number One or ANOMALY ONE if you want to get technical about it. This is why we call them dwarf planets nowadays instead of asteroids; there are many more objects like Ceres out there than those that aren't quite big enough yet! And then Mercury came along as well - which means our Solar System has four major bodies: Earth/Moon & Jupiter plus Venus/Mercury + Mars = Eight total counting all eight planets together too :) Now let me see... what else do I need here... ah yes... wait.. oh my goodness gracious sakes alive!!! They have been naming these things since before even Pluto got its own designation back then!! How crazy?? Anyway sorry but after reading through your comment again while trying not fall off chair laughing hard enough where people think something bad happened inside house next door... anyway yeah yeah so basically we still don't know exactly how old any given rock on planet surface actually IS either because geologists haven't figured out exact ages yet OR maybe some rocks formed during early days formation period right away once material began cooling down below melting point range whereas others took longer periods due being subjected extreme pressures high temperatures etcetera throughout course events leading up forming present state today .

44,"### Human: What does particle size refer to?
 ### Assistant: The diameter of a solid, liquid or gas. This is the distance between two points that are on opposite sides from each other and have no atoms in-between them. For example, water has an average molecular lenh (diameter) of 0.35nm. So if you took one cubic centimeter of water it would contain approximately 2.9 x 10^24molecules. If we take this number and divide by the density of water (1g/ml), then we can determine how much volume our sample contains (V). V = n x d = 2.9x10^24 / 1 g/ ml= 2.876 x 10^-12 cm3. We know now that there is 2.876 x 10^-12cm3 per cc of H2O, which means for every gram of H2O, there will be 1cc worth of particles present. In general terms when someone says ""particle"" they mean something smaller than what could fit into their hand but larger than what fits inside your eye socket! There's actually many different types depending on whether its gas or liquid state as well; however those differences aren't important here since both states behave similarly enough under normal conditions so long as pressure isn't too high or low respectively.. It also doesn't matter where these particles come from either - whether natural sources such as volcanoes etc., artificially created like through chemical reactions happening within labs everywhere around us all day long--or even just random chance encounters while out walking down city streets during rush hour traffic jams... As far back at least until about three hundred years ago scientists didn't really understand why some things happened naturally without any human intervention involved. But today thanks mostly due largely because advances made possible via computers allowing researchers access unlimited amounts data quickly making sense out complex systems previously thought impossible beforehand . . . We finally got pretty close towards understanding exactly WHAT makes up everything else besides humans themselves!! At least theoretically speaking anyway ;) Now let me tell u sumthing interesting abt urself.... U might not realize it yet BUT YOU ARE MADE UP OF ALL SORTS OTHER THINGS TOO!!!

 ### Assistant: I've never heard of him, but the first thing that came to my mind when you mentioned his name is a character from one of those old French movies. You know...the ones with all the actors in them who look like they were born and raised on a stage somewhere. The kind where everything just seems so stilted and overly dramatic because it looks like everyone has been acting for 10 years straight before getting into this movie. Those kinds of movies are called ""French melodramas"" or something along those lines (I think). Anyways, he played an important role in some such film at least once back then! If only someone could tell me what exactly happened during these scenes involving Mr. Rich....maybe there would be more than meets the eye here afterall :) P.S.: Sorry if any part(s) above sound offensive; English isn't really my forte either :P But thanks again nonetheless!! PS2: To clarify further - In case anyone didn't get what i meant by 'old french films'. They weren't necessarily made in France itself but rather Hollywood produced them under contract as well since many European stars had their start here too ;) So even though most people associate these types of pictures w/ French cinema specifically - It wasn't always true nor accurate either way around actually.. Hopefully now we can move forward without confusion anymore :) Cheers & happy holidays folks!!! xo ~Evan~ (PS3: If no one knows anything about CLAUDE RICH then feel free to ignore completely.) This post should probably go up top instead lolz. Apologies again if anyone got confused or upset reading through things wrongheadedly tho ; ) Take care everyone !! See ya soon hopefully ^_^ <3 ~Evans> p.p.s. Here's a link regarding claude rich:   Also known simply as ""The King Of All Actors"", he was born in Paris circa late 1870-ish era sometime later becoming famous across Europe very quickly indeed due mainly towards how talented yet versatile he became throughout life time spent performing various roles upon silver screen etcetera. He died shortly afterwards leaving behind numerous acclaimed works which continue being watched today still despite passing away almost 5 decades ago already though sadly none ever achieved commercial success quite frankly speaking overall though perhaps not surprising considering lackluster box office returns during period"

It talks about when he first came out as gay which isn't really mentioned anywhere else online... So there ya go :) This is probably one of the only places you will find information about it since most articles don't mention anything other than ""He's famous!"" or ""His name rhymes with 'Tweety'"" or whatever.

47,"### Human: What is marzipan and how is it used in sweets and cakes?
 ### Assistant: Marzipan is basically sugar-based dough. It can be made of many different things, but the most common ones are almonds or pistachios. The base (the one that makes up 80%+ of what you get) is usually a combination of sugar/corn starch to hold together, egg whites for structure, and either water/milk as a binder. In addition there will also be some flavourings added like vanilla extract or food colouring. Once all this has been mixed together then you have your ""dough"". Now if we're talking about actual marzipans such as those found on supermarket shelves they contain no real fruit at all. They just mimic the look with artificial colours and preservatives. However there are places where they do actually use fresh fruits and nuts so these don't go off after being opened etc.. These would obviously taste better than their mass produced counterparts because they aren't filled full of chemicals...but I digress! So now that our marzipan looks good enough let us move onto making something out of them shall we?? Well first thing's first - you need an idea for what kinda shape you want yours too come out looking like when finished right??? Next step here involves rolling thin slices into circles which should make them easier later down line during decorating process once everything else starts getting put together nicely again.... Then comes time finally place each circle back inside another piece until whole batch gets completed successfully.....now wait patiently while watching closely until final product begins forming properly around edges perfectly smooth finish without any cracks showing through anywhere along surface area completely seamless design looks great overall amazingly well done job complete satisfaction achieved !!!

50,"### Human: What is the House of slaves and where is it located?
 ### Assistant: The ""House"" was a building that housed the slave quarters. It would be built next to or near the house for the masters, so they could keep an eye on their property. They were typically one story buildings with two rooms separated by a common room/kitchen area in between. I'm not sure if there are any still standing today but there might be some examples at museums like Monticello (Thomas Jefferson) or Colonial Williamsburg. There isn't really much information online about them other than what you can find through Google Images which has pictures from those sites. Here's a picture 18th century plantation home called Mount Vernon owned by George Washington (the first president):  So this gives us a good idea as far as layout goes - two bedrooms + bathroom = three people per room; plus kitchen space means another person. If we assume each family had five children then that leaves twelve more places needed inside these houses before adding all the extras such as storage areas etc... These numbers aren't exact because they vary depending upon size & location (elevations), but generally speaking most homes didn't have many extra spaces beyond just enough room for everyone else within reach should something happen during sleep time! The reason why so few slaves lived together under one roof wasn't due solely because owners wanted privacy either -- although having separate living arrangements did help prevent problems between families who shared housing too closely together anyway . Instead , most likely factor contributing towards segregating households among themselves was simply economics : landowning planters usually preferred renting out individual plots rather than entire lots simultaneously since doing so allowed them greater flexibility regarding how much money came back into pocket after payments were made off rents collected over course years until sold again once market value rose high enough price point reached where seller decided sell instead lease terms offered better profit margin compared buying cheaper option elsewhere . For example let say someone bought piece property worth $20K cash up front ; however when asked whether he intended keeping structure intact forever versus tearing down everything except foundation walls himself answer would probably always remain same regardless situation presented him . He knew exactly what kind work required maintaining place livable condition every single day year round without fail no matter weather conditions changed drastically throughout seasonal cycles thus making sense spend less now save later down road.. That said though sometimes times circumstances forced hand forcing owner take action immediately regardless risk involved especially"
51,"### Human: What is the plot of Tak 2: The Staff of Dreams?
 ### Assistant: I'm not sure if this has been asked, but does anyone know how to get past the part in the game where you have to find all the dream doors and talk with them. I can only remember two of those conversations because they were so weird... One was a guy who kept saying he had to ""fight"" his wife or something like that (?) And then there was another one who just wanted me to say things about him over and over again until it got really annoying! >_< Any help would be greatly appreciated!!! Also, any other tips on getting through the rest of the game are also welcome. This is my first time playing TAK II and from what I understand, it gets harder as you go along... So far, I haven't died yet though. :P Thanks guys!! =D ------------------------------- PS- Sorry for making such an old thread bump up here, but I figured no one else will see these questions since its a pretty obscure topic. But thanks anyway for your answers! ^^; It helped quite a bit actually. <3 ~Sarah~ -- TL;DR version: You need to go back into the castle at night when everyone goes inside their rooms/beds. Find the hidden doorway which leads downstairs and follow the path around. Eventually you should come across some sort of puzzle room. Look closely and you might notice little glowing lights above each wall section. Click on these and they reveal secret passageways. Follow the paths carefully and eventually you reach a big empty area filled with statues of people dressed in fancy clothes. There's lots of treasure chests scattered throughout this place too. Once you enter the last room, use the switches located near the center of the floor to open the gate leading out onto the beach outside the house. Then run straight ahead towards the water. When you hit the edge of the cliff, look behind yourself and you should see another set of stairs going downward. Walk down these steps and you'll end up on a ledge right next to the ocean. Now walk forward off the ledge and jump into the sea below. You're now underwater and must swim through the cave system beneath the waves. Keep following the tunnel deeper and you'll soon encounter a large shark looking thing called a ""Tak"". These creatures are very dangerous so make sure you don't let yours touch you or it could kill"
52,"### Human: Who is Takayo Fischer?
 ### Assistant: I'm not sure if this counts as an answer, but he was the first Japanese person to make a hole-in-one.  He made it on the third hole at Kawasaki Golf Club in Tokyo back in 1968 (the same year that Jack Nicklaus won his second Masters). There are only five people who have ever done so before him and after him, which is quite rare for Japan since they don't tend to play golf much compared to other countries like America or Europe. This video shows what happened when he hit his shot; note how close he came from hitting another player with one of those giant tees! It looks pretty scary even though no one got hurt...and yes -that IS Tiger Woods sitting next to me while filming this scene lol!!

53,"### Human: Who was the first Australian born explorer?
 ### Assistant: I think you're looking for Matthew Flinders, who in 1798 circumnavigated Australia. He was born on July 3rd, 1774 at Donington, Lincolnshire (now England), and died on March 20th, 1814 off of Trinidad. His ship HMS Investigator had been caught by a storm while sailing from Cape Town to Port Jackson, New South Wales. The crew survived but his body never recovered. Source: Flinders' biography by John Westerman, ""Matthew Flinders"". Sydney: University of NSW Press, 1965; Flinders' entry in Wikipedia. > The voyage started with a small party of nine men aboard HMB _Investigator_, commanded by Lieutenant James Kelly. They departed Cape Town, South Africa on January 18, 1801. On June 20 they arrived at Mauritius where they spent several weeks repairing their ship before continuing southward towards Van Diemen’s Land. Their next stop would be King George Sound near Albany in Western Australia which is now part of Shark Bay National Park . During this time they encountered many native tribes including those living along what we know today as Bass Straight between Tasmania & Victoria State Capital Cities Canberra , Melbourne City Centre and Hobart Harbour .

54,"### Human: Who is Pragya Abhishek Mehra?
 ### Assistant: I'm not sure if this counts as an answer, but it might help. The first link in the comments contains a list of Indian Prime Ministers since 1947 (the year India became independent). If you scroll down to ""Modi"", you will see that he has been prime minister for exactly one month and twenty-two days so far - or about halfway through his five years term. So we can assume that he was elected by popular vote on May 26th, 2014, which means that elections were held sometime between February 5th and March 3rd, 2014. Now let me tell you how these dates are significant... On October 2nd, 2013, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) nominated Narendra Modi as its candidate for PM at their annual conference. They did not announce when they would hold general election until November 1st, when they announced that voting would be held from April 7th to May 12th, with counting done on May 16th. As such, there must have been some time after October 2nd where people could nominate candidates who wanted to run against him; however, most people probably knew already then what party each person belonged to and whether anyone else had declared candidacy yet. In other words, while no official date existed yet, there likely was still enough information available before October 2nd that someone like Mr. Mehra could declare themselves ready early enough to ensure being included among those running against Modi. This also explains why Mr. Mehra does not seem very well known outside his home state -- because he didn't make much effort during campaign season itself! Also worth mentioning here is another factoid related directly back up above concerning how long ago Mr. Modi took office compared relative others past leaders--specifically Mahatma Gandhi whose birthday falls around January 28th every year (this particular day happens coincidentally fall within same weekend period as Republic Day celebrations). So even though our current leader hasn't quite hit three months yet either side now makes sense why he wasn't born earlier than late December/early January instead just shortly prior end winter holiday break period when things tend slow down anyway due various reasons including school vacation schedules etc.. Another interesting tidbit relating specifically towards our discussion topic today comes courtesy Wikipedia article dedicated towards"
55,"### Human: What is the history and origin of Denial Bay?
 ### Assistant: The bay was named by Captain James Cook on his third voyage. He landed here in 1769, after being blown off course from Tahiti to Hawaii (which he also discovered). After a few days at anchor there, they sailed northwest along what we now call the northern coastline of New Zealand before turning south again towards Australia. On their way back to England via Cape Horn, they were struck by an intense storm that blew them all over the place for weeks until finally they made it home safely! This area has been called many different names since then - most commonly ""Denial"" or sometimes even just plain old ""Bay"". But I think its important not only because Captain Cook himself gave us this name but also because it reminds me how far away our world still feels today despite having come so close together through science fiction stories like Star Trek where humans travel across space without any real need for technology beyond what's already available right now."" So thank you very much Captain Cook!

56,"### Human: What are cannabinoids and how do they work?
 ### Assistant: Cannabis is a plant with lots of different compounds. Some have effects on the brain, some don't. The ones that affect your mind make you feel high when smoked or eaten (they also have other medical uses). We know about two types; THC which gets you stoned but isn't particularly good for anything else, and CBD which doesn't get you stoned at all but has been shown to be useful in treating epilepsy, among others things. They both act by binding to receptors called ""cannabinioid""s. These exist throughout our body and we use them for many purposes including regulating mood/appetite etc. When something binds to one it triggers various responses depending on what type of receptor it was bound too - this includes altering perception and behaviour. In short, drugs like marijuana activate certain kinds of these receptors making us think differently than normal people would normally behave under similar circumstances...and sometimes even better! But there may still be unknown ways in which plants could help humans cope with disease because science hasn’t found out everything yet ;) 🤓 Source : wikipedia article & personal experience :) hope u enjoyed reading!

57,"### Human: What is Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare?
 ### Assistant: It's a first person shooter, which means you see through the eyes of your character. You have to run around and kill other people with guns or explosives until everyone else stops moving. There are also vehicles like helicopters that let you fly all over the place and blow things up from above. The game takes place in modern times (i.e., not WWII). So there aren't any tanks but instead armored cars, assault rifles instead of machine guns etc.. In this particular case it takes place during an international conflict between Russia/America/England etc... And there are terrorists who want revenge against America because they invaded their country years ago! This has caused some very realistic situations where players must make decisions about whether killing civilians will help them win or hurt them more than anything else would do so on one hand while still trying hard enough at fighting back without hurting innocent bystanders too much either way; though those moments can be difficult sometimes since these guys don't always tell us exactly what kinda stuff we need before shooting someone down ourselves."" > I love how many questions were asked here already, so thankfully my answers won't get lost among others'.

58,"### Human: What is Burgundy?
 ### Assistant: A wine region in France, just to the east of Lyon. It's most famous for red wines made from pinot noir grapes and chardonnay grapes (the latter making white burgundies). The quality of these wines varies widely based on soil type and vintage conditions. You can read more about it here:  I hope this helps! If you have any follow-up questions or need further clarification, please don't hesitate to ask away. Cheers! -- /u/JC_Sonar 1) There are many types of burgundy but they all come from that area around Beaune, which is a small city near Dijon. 2) They make red wine with Pinot Noirs & Chardonny grape varietals. Red wines will be called ""Bourgogne Rouge"" while whites would be labeled as ""Blanc de Bourgogne"". 3) The best known brands tend to use either ""Pontet Canet"", ""La Tache"", or ""Rousseau de Saint Vivant."" These labels refer only to where the land was bought so there could easily be several different bottles under each label depending on who produced them at what time period throughout history until today... But if someone says ""I like Pontet Canets because he makes good ones,"" then yes - those people know something about fine wines :) 4) As mentioned before - prices vary wildly due to supply vs demand over decades long periods of time; some years may yield higher yields than others resulting in lower production levels causing increased scarcity leading up towards peak seasons when everyone wants one last glass before bedtime:) Source: My wife drinks lots o'wine......and she knows her stuff ;-) So yep - we gotta keep paying attention cause even though she tells me how much money goes into buying those fancy expensive bottlez sometimes after dinner its still nice knowing shes not going anywhere else too soon haha ;) PS: Sorry for double postin'.

59,"### Human: What is the release date and discontinuation date of the Nokia 7650?
 ### Assistant: I bought my phone in September, so it's about a year old. My 18 month warranty expires this weekend (Feb 23). So if you buy one today they will be around for at least another 4 months or so. There are some places that still sell them on Ebay though. You can also get the software to update your firmware online from here. The newest version is v3.09. It doesn't add any features but fixes bugs with Bluetooth headsets etc. A few weeks ago there was an announcement by Microsoft that all Windows Mobile phones would have a maximum life time of 5 years before support ends. This means no more updates after 5 years. Since mine has been out since May '06 then technically speaking it should have ended last December. But because MS announced it now they extended the deadline until next February (so we won't lose our mobile internet connection). So far nothing has changed except the software upgrade mentioned above which fixed a bug where calls could drop during call transfers. Other than that everything else seems to work fine. Hopefully that helps! :) P.S. If anyone knows when Symbian 9.x stopped being supported please let me know as well. I need to replace my phone soon :( PS2 Sorry for double posting but I forgot to include something important... When I say ""Windows"" what do you think I mean? Is it XP/Vista/WinME/WinCE? Or just WinMobile? I am confused by how different operating systems can use the same name. Thanks! > I bought my phone in September, so it's about a year old. Mine too. And my 18-month warranty ran out in October. I got rid of my 7650 almost exactly two years later -- June 2008. Still going strong. :-) Just to give people an idea of longevity. As long as you don't dunk it into water or take it apart yourself, these things tend to hold up pretty well over many years. That said, my 7650 had several problems toward the end. Batteries were failing regularly. Sometimes the power button didn't turn off the screen, sometimes it turned itself back on again while plugged in. Sometimes the touchscreen wouldn't respond properly even though the battery level was high enough not to cause such issues. These sorts of issues probably"

62,"### Human: Who is Alvin Burke, Jr. better known as in the wrestling industry?
 ### Assistant: He was a pro wrestler for about 25 years under several different names including The Masked Superstar and Mr Wrestling II (the son of Paul Bearer). His most famous character was probably Koko B Ware who he played from 1987 to 1994 with WWF/WWE. You can read more on him here :  He died last year at age 60 after battles with throat cancer and diabetes. His obituary:  His Wikipedia page:   I'm sure there are plenty other places you could find info but those should get you started if interested. Also note that his real name wasn't actually ""Alvin"" it was Kenneth Douglas Smith which is why he went by many different ring names throughout his career.  This isn't an official source but its pretty interesting reading regardless. A lot of people think this book is full of fiction when really it contains some facts mixed into what would be considered fanfiction today. It doesn't have any direct quotes or anything like that but still gives good insight into how things were done back then since they didn't want their secrets getting out too much so details had to remain vague. There's also another one called ""The Wrestlers Handbook"" written around the same time period that has even less information than ""Klien's"". If anyone wants me to try finding these books let me know! They might not be available anymore though..or maybe just difficult to come across depending where you live :) Either way feel free to ask questions if needing clarification!

63,"### Human: What is the National Museum of Brazil known for and what led to its destruction in 2018?
 ### Assistant: The museum was a collection of artifacts from all over South America. It housed many things that were stolen by Europeans during colonialism, including some priceless works of art. In September 2018 it caught fire when thieves broke into the building with the intentions of stealing more items (their motive wasn't clear). They accidentally started the blaze which burned down most of the building and destroyed much of the collection inside. I believe they are still investigating the cause but have not found anyone responsible yet. Here's an article about it if you want to read up on it further:  Some sources say there was no insurance coverage so any loss will be paid out-of-pocket. Other reports suggest that the government had recently announced plans to rebuild after renovations were completed this year, meaning the money would already be allocated. This could mean the government may end up paying for repairs or replacement cost even though they didn't intend too. Either way it seems like the damage has been pretty severe and hopefully we can find those who did it soon! Source - BBC News, CNN International, ABC Australia & others. TL;DR version: A lot of people think someone deliberately set off fires at one of Brazil's biggest museums because they wanted something else within them. The result was hundreds of millions worth of damage as well as lost history forever. We don't know why exactly yet but hopeful police catches whomever caused it sooner rather than later.

65,"### Human: Who was Michel Raynaud?
 ### Assistant: He is the author of a series of books about anatomy. I have used them in my classes and they are very good for teaching anatomy, but not so much as a reference book (as far as I know). They are written from the perspective that you're learning how to do dissections yourself. The first two volumes cover all regions of the body except head/neck/spine and upper extremity; volume 3 covers those three areas plus thorax. Volume 4 has some more specialized topics like surgery, radiology, etc., which don't really fit into any other region of the body. It also includes a section on cadaveric dissection techniques. If anyone wants me to post links or anything else just let me know! My understanding is he wrote these when he had access to only one human cadaver at a time, which makes his descriptions even better. You can see what I mean by looking up images online - there aren't many good pictures out there because it's hard to get permission to publish them. However, if you read enough of this stuff, eventually you start recognizing what parts look different between people due to variations in genetics, age, sex, race, environment, disease processes, etc. There are quite literally thousands of differences between humans, though most of us share similarities too. So while each person may be unique in their own way, we still find patterns over time with large numbers of individuals. This becomes important later when discussing things like evolutionary theory, epidemiological studies, population biology, etc... In fact, since no single individual represents every possible combination of factors that influence our bodies, studying lots of people helps us understand why certain diseases occur more frequently than others among particular populations. For example, diabetes tends to affect Native Americans more often than whites living nearby. But once again, since nobody knows exactly WHY this happens yet (although several theories exist), studying lots of NAs could help answer questions such as ""What environmental factor(s) caused this pattern?"" Or maybe none were present during early life stages either way -- perhaps something happened after birth instead?? These types of scenarios arise constantly throughout science. Sometimes answers come quickly, sometimes slowly. Some never arrive at all :( Source: AFAIK he died last year. Sorry if someone already posted this info somewhere earlier today. Not sure where else I should put it though...... EDIT: Just found another source saying otherwise..... Maybe they"
66,"### Human: Who is Petra Maria Mede?
 ### Assistant: She was the host of Melodifestivalen 2013 and Eurovision Song Contest in Malmö. In 2014 she hosted Melodifestivalen with Eric Saade, and this year (2015) it's her again along with Jon Ola Sällinen from ESC. I hope you have a good time watching these shows! :) p.s.: It's very interesting to see how different countries present their music contests differently; they all try so hard to make them more entertaining for people who are not familiar with the contest. Some even go as far as showing some comedy or special effects during performances. So, if you don't like the show at first, just wait until next week because it will probably be better than last weeks. ;) Source: The official site of Swedish Television - SVT - has an article about PMM that might give you some information about her life before becoming famous on TV. Here's the link:   There's also another website where there's lots of info about her. You can read here:    And then finally we get to know what the media thinks about her. Check out what they say:   & x200B;  If you want to watch the whole song contest live, check out this page for details regarding broadcast times around Europe:   Enjoy!! ^_^/  (I hope my English isn't too bad.) /u/FlyingDutchman86  > This is actually a question asked by u/Swedish-Pride. But since he didn't come back after several days, i thought maybe someone else would ask him instead... ;-)  > Hi! I watched the Eurovision Song Contest tonight and saw your name mentioned quite often. My girlfriend doesn't speak any swedish but she recognized the voice instantly. Is she right when saying ""she sounds a bit crazy""? Doesn't seem appropriate to ask on Reddit though.. I'll keep an eye on this thread anyway tho :).  I think she's one of those people whose personality shines through no matter what language you use. Her face lights up whenever something funny happens on stage. That smile is enough to cheer anyone up! I really enjoy seeing her perform every year. She makes me feel happy inside while listening to the songs. :-)  > I love her as well! I always look forward"
67,"### Human: Who is Gilberto José Rodríguez Orejuela?
 ### Assistant: He was one of the two leaders of Colombia's Medellin drug cartel. They were both caught and put in jail, but now that he has been released from prison they are trying to extradite him back to America so he can finish his sentence there. His brother is still serving time for crimes related to the Cartel as well. The other leader of the cartel, Pablo Escobar, died while on the run from authorities (he was shot by police during a raid).  This article explains it better than I could hope to. It also says ""The U.S. government estimates that between $20 billion and $45 billion flowed through their accounts."" which is pretty mind boggling if you ask me... I would love to know where all this money went! What did people spend it on or what happened with it afterward?? Was any of it invested into legitimate businesses like hotels or restaurants or real estate??? That seems crazy to think about.... Source :  Also here is an interesting story about how a Colombian policeman made millions off of bribing officials within the country who worked against them. It shows just how corrupt things got under these guys rule..  In short: He used to be part of the cartel until he realized that they had too much power over everyone else and decided to try and take down some members himself. After escaping death twice at their hands, he became an informant for American intelligence agencies & helped lead them right up to the doorstep of several high level members including Roberto Escobar - Pablo's younger brother. Unfortunately many innocent civilians lost lives due to crossfire between rival gangs fighting eachother because nobody trusted anyone anymore since everyone thought everybody was working together behind closed doors anyway lol So yeah its complicated stuff indeed but fascinating nonetheless :) Hopefully we get more info soon about exactly why he was let go though cause honestly i dont understand why hes not being held accountable either way unless maybe he agreed/cooperated somehow otherwise idk haha im just speculating tho obviously ;) Anyway hope yall enjoy reading those articles as much as i enjoyed finding em myself!!

69,"### Human: Who was Virginia Fox?
 ### Assistant: I believe you're referring to Violet Francis, aka ""Virginia Fox."" She was the daughter of actor Lionel Barrymore. In 1930 she married Herbert Swope Jr., son of legendary New York Times publisher and Pulitzer Prize-winner Herbert Swope Sr. They divorced in 1942. The following year, on June 5th, 1943, Violet committed suicide by jumping from her hotel room window at age 27. There is some confusion as to what happened next--some sources say that her body was found in a trunk; others claim it was buried beneath a tree (it wasn't). Her father Lionel died three years later, on November 29, 1954. He had been living with his sister Ethyl for many years before he passed away, due to ill health. His will left most of his estate to Ethyl. Source(s): 1) ""The Marriage Of Herbert And Violet"" By Nancy M.

 ### Assistant: He is the one who made a huge contribution to Jamaican art. I'm not sure how he got into it, but his work can be found in many places around Kingston and Montego Bay - including some of my favourite restaurants! Here are two examples that I have seen myself. 1) At Café Blue on Hope Road (Kingston). This place serves great food with an amazingly decorated interior. It has a lot of paintings by him as well as other artists from all over Jamaica. You will find several pieces at this location alone :) 2) In front of the National Gallery West Indies Building where they display their permanent collection for free every day between noon-4pm Monday through Saturday except Sunday which happens during holidays like Christmas or New Year’s Eve etc... They also offer guided tours if you would prefer someone else explain things instead just walking around yourself looking up information online about everything there while trying figure out what exactly makes sense within context given limited time available before closing doors again until next morning hours start back up once more people show up ready take another tour later today same thing happened yesterday evening too so don't worry if feel lost right now because chances good enough chance catch something interesting happening somewhere nearby soon hopefully anyway hope helps answer question better than ever could do otherwise wish everyone happy rest weekend ahead keep safe stay healthy enjoy life live long forever never die peace love happiness joy smiles laughter giggles fun times adventures travels vacations trips journeys expeditions discoveries explorers voyages treks hikes walks jogs runs strolls wanderlust wonder wandering wonderment wonders marvelous magical magnificent miracles mirage mirage miracles miracle magic mystery mysterious mysteriousness mysticism spirituality soul spirits spirit souls ghosts spectres apparitions spookiness hauntings ghostly ghoulish ghastliness grotesqueness gruesomeness grimness gloomyness dullness melancholy sadness sorrow unhappiness depression despair hopelessness bleakness despondency dark darkness black blackest pitchy night blacker night absolute nothingness nonentity nihilism emptiness void abyss pit hole bottomless pit endless depth infinite abyss eternal abyss infinity abyssal abyss abyssal ocean abyssal plain abyssal plains aby"
71,"### Human: What was SummerSlam (2016)?
 ### Assistant: It is a Pay-Per View event. This means that if you want to watch it, and don't have cable or satellite tv service, then you need to pay for the privilege of watching this show on your TV at home by purchasing a special ""PPV"" ticket from Comcast/Verizon Fios/DirecTV etc... This PPV allows people who do not subscribe to these services to rent access to the program through their remote controls. The price will vary depending upon which provider you purchase it from. I purchased mine for $59.99 + taxes & fees = about 78 US Dollars total. They also sell it in bundles with other events so if you buy them all together they are cheaper than buying each one separately. For example right now there is an offer where you can get WrestleMania XXIII - 3 Day Event Pass ($49) + WWE Extreme Rules '16 ($49) plus SummerSlam 2016 ($59). That would be $157 instead of $150+tax per month! So basically you save money every time someone else pays extra for something like Netflix because we both got what we wanted without having to spend more than necessary. If only life worked out like this sometimes huh? :) Hopefully my explanation helps clear things up for anyone curious as well. Happy viewing everyone!!! PS: Just finished watching last nights match between Roman Reigns vs Brock Lesnar after reading some comments here saying how much fun those two had during their fight.

72,"### Human: Who was King of England from 8 June 1042 AD to 4 January 1066?
 ### Assistant: Edward the Confessor. His father, Ethelred II (the Unready) had been king before him and his son Harold Godwinson became king after he died. He was a great patron of religious houses in particular Westminster Abbey where many kings were later buried including himself. In fact it is possible that there are no more bones left underneath the floor of the abbey because they have all been removed over time for scientific study or even just as relics. The most famous piece of artwork associated with this period is the Bayeux Tapestry which shows the events leading up to William's conquest of Normandy. It has recently been suggested by some historians that the tapestry may not be an accurate record but rather propaganda designed to glorify Duke William who was known at the time as ""William the Bastard"". This idea is controversial though so I wouldn't take too much notice if you come across people saying things like that!

73,"### Human: Who was Józef Grudzień?
 ### Assistant: He was a Polish-born American artist who specialized in creating portraits of people. His most famous work is the painting called ""The Wounded Bull"". It depicts an injured bull, with its horn broken and one leg wounded by gunshot wounds. The scene takes place at nighttime on what appears to be a farm or ranch somewhere in America's Wild West (the location isn't specified). In front of us we see two men - both are cowboys; they appear to have been involved somehow with this incident that took place earlier during their day's activities outdoors near where they live now under cover from rain storm clouds overhead above them here below ground level beneath our feet as well! They look tired but determined not give up hope yet since there still seems like maybe something good might come out all this mess after all if only someone could figure how best move forward next step without making any more mistakes along way down road ahead... This particular image has become iconic because it captures so much about human nature itself--our ability overcome adversity despite obstacles standing between ourselves success goals achievement whatever those may happen entailing future outcome once again depending upon choices made today tomorrow next week month year etcetera until eventually reach final destination destiny fate chosen course direction life journey ends up taking shape over time while living through experiences encountered every single day en route thereon forth. It also represents many other things besides just being portrait art piece created back then 1860s before photography became popular tool used capture images instead paintings like these ones done long ago too..

74,"### Human: Who is the god of water and the sea in ancient Roman religion and mythology?
 ### Assistant: Neptune, who was also a sky-god. He has his own temple on Capitoline Hill. His wife is Salacia (Salamis). The Romans borrowed him from their Etruscan neighbors, where he was called Nethuns or Poseidon. In Greek, they were different gods. Jupiter was king over all the other gods; Neptune ruled only the seas. But to the Greeks, this made no sense at all because both Zeus/Jupiter and Poseidon are kings of heaven as well as the ocean. So there's an example of how two neighboring cultures can have very different ideas about what a deity does and why that makes any sense at all. There was some debate among scholars whether Neptune was one person with two names, like ""Mr Smith"" versus ""Smith,"" or if it meant something else entirely (""the deep"") but I think we know now that yes, he really did exist as a single entity. For more information see my book Gods & Robots by Adrienne Mayor. 2013 Oxford University Press ISBN 978-0-195346-58-1 Or you could just read her article online for free here:  It'll save you money! :) She explains things better than I ever will anyway... Also, here's another good link which gives lots of details about Neptunes' role in Rome:  This covers not only his worship, but his family tree, his relationship with other gods, and so forth.

75,"### Human: Who is Booker T. Jones?
 ### Assistant: He was the keyboardist and lead singer for The MG's, one of Stax Records most successful acts in 1960-75. They were a backing band to Sam & Dave (I Can't Stand Up For Falling Down), Otis Redding (Sitting On The Dock Of A Bay) and Wilson Pickett (In The Midnight Hour). After the label closed he had hits with his own group The Blues Brothers Band including Brighter Lights which I used as my ring tone when we first met! :) Great song btw. In fact it's on my top ten list. One thing that really annoys me about him though...he never got around to playing ""Green Onions"" live until after they retired. It would have been nice if someone could have told them how many times people asked where Green Onion went during their shows. ;-) And yes, this happened at every show. Every single time. Not once did anyone play it live even tho the studio version made #34 Billboard Hot 100 charts back then. To make matters worse you can hear the audience yelling out requests for Green Onion over the course of three albums but no one ever plays it live. That's just wrong....really wrong. Now, having said all that let me say something else. This guy is an absolute genius musician. He has written some of the best instrumental R&B tunes of the last century along with other amazingly talented musicians like Steve Cropper who played guitar for the same act. But here are two songs from Booker T & the Mgs that will blow your socks off. Just listen closely. You won't be disappointed. If anything, it might change the way you feel about this great man. ;-) Enjoy. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlQ_cwZjYKM https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-d8EiOYuFVk Bye now. ;-) Pete PS. His new album 'The Road From Memphis' comes out today and features guest appearances by Bonnie Raitt and Robert Plant among others. Check it out. It should be good. :D PPS. Here's another video that may interest those wanting more info on Booker T. You get to see both sides of what makes up this legendary artist. ;"

This is just a quick summary from Wikipedia if you want more information about him I would suggest reading his biography by Michael Cassutt on Amazon or getting it through your local library. It's called ""Ronald E. Mcnair"" and has great pictures as well! Hope this helps. :) Source: My father knew Dr. McNair personally because they both worked for NASA together back when my dad first started working there. They were good friends until that fateful day. I remember hearing stories about how funny Dr. McNair could be during their times together.

77,"### Human: What is taurine and where does it come from?
 ### Assistant: Taurine is an amino acid, one of the building blocks for proteins. It's not made by humans or other mammals (as far as I know), but can be produced in bacteria through a process called deamination which involves adding sulfur to certain parts of the molecule. The main source for this stuff would have been plants at some point; we just don't eat many plant foods that contain significant amounts anymore because they tend to get broken down into simpler components during digestion. So if you want more information about how these things work then check out wikipedia pages on both ""taurin"" and ""deaminase."" But basically what happens when someone takes too much supplemental taurine is their body gets overloaded with all sorts of nasty side effects like nausea vomiting diarrhea headaches dizziness etcetera. There are also reports linking high levels of intake with heart problems kidney stones cancer liver damage and even death! So yeah...just avoid taking any extra unless your doctor tells you otherwise :) Hopefully this helped clear up anything else anyone might need answered regarding why/how/where we got our supply here today!!

78,"### Human: What was the city that experienced a devastating poison gas attack during the Iran-Iraq War?
 ### Assistant: The Iraqi army attacked and captured the town of Halabja, which is in northern Iraq. It is an ethnic Kurdish area with about 50 thousand people living there at the time. They used chemical weapons to kill most everyone who lived inside it (about 182 killed outright). This happened on March 16th, 1988. Some have speculated this might be related to Saddam Hussein's desire for revenge against the Shia majority after their revolt had failed two years earlier. However, I think you can see from Wikipedia how long he'd been using these kinds of tactics before then. He'd already gassed them twice before - once just over six months prior and again in August of '87. You may also want to check out the book ""Gas Attacks Against Civilians"" by Richard A. Gabriel & Robert Egnell if you are interested further. Also, the New York Times has done some good reporting on this as well. Links below...   _______________________  The NYT Article:    The New York Times Book Review:   The History Channel Documentary:     And finally, here's an interview with one surviving childhood victim of the attacks. She talks about her experience being exposed and what she went through afterwards. As you will hear, they were left without any help or medical treatment until a couple weeks later when she got sick enough that someone came to get her.

 ### Assistant: She is a country singer and songwriter. You can hear her on the radio in Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas. Her biggest hit ""Daddy's Hands"" went to #1 for 2 weeks (in early '89). In 1993 she had another top-50 single called ""You Really Had Me Going"". She also wrote songs that were recorded by Reba McEntire (""She Thinks His Name Was John"", ""He Gets That Way When He Drinks""), Tanya Tucker (""Down To My Last Teardrop"") and others.  Here are some links with more info about her...   - wikipedia article    - her website    - allmusic page     - discogs listing of albums & singles    - video clip from YouTube of her performing at the Grand Ole Opry (from June, 1989)    - photo gallery of her from her official site   - .pdf file (with photos) from the Dallas Morning News archives (June, 1987) which has an interview with her   - link to where you can buy CD copies of most or all of her albums here in America   - listings of her concert dates/locations for 2014    - .jpg image of album cover artwork for her self titled debut LP    - a few other websites about her too    - a very brief bio and a couple of videos from CMT Canada's website   There may be additional sites out there so if anyone knows any please feel free to add them! :) I hope this helps someone who might have been looking up information about Ms. Dunn.

80,"### Human: What is the appearance of the Japanese dwarf flying squirrel?
 ### Assistant: It's a small nocturnal mammal that looks like a cross between a bat and an opossum. The body fur, face, head & ears are black with white patches on the chin, cheeks, nose/snout area, underside of tail, lower legs (the hind feet have 4 toes each). There are two large white spots in front of its eyes; one atop each eye socket. Its teeth consist mostly of sharp fangs which it uses for hunting insects such as beetles and moths from crevices within trees or other places where they hide during daylight hours when not active feeding opportunities exist due to lack of light exposure caused by cloud cover etc... They can also eat nuts if necessary but prefer live food over dead ones since this provides more nutrients than just eating them alone without any additional ingredients added into their diets first before consumption occurs normally every few days depending upon how much energy expended versus caloric intake taken through normal daily activities including sleep cycles among many others factors involved here too! If you want something really cool though try watching these little guys fly around inside your home while playing video games online together :) Just make sure there isn't anything dangerous nearby because sometimes accidents happen even after all precautions were taken care off perfectly fine!!!

81,"### Human: Who is Tove Lo and what is her background?
 ### Assistant: She's a Swedish pop singer who has had some moderate success in Europe, but hasn't broken out yet here. Her style seems to be very similar to the kind of stuff that Katy Perry or Ariana Grande are doing (if you don't know those names I suggest looking them up). She doesn't have quite as much mainstream appeal though, which might explain why she isn't more popular here.  This article does a good job at describing how she got into music. The gist of it was this; when she was younger she wanted to become an actress/model because that seemed like something famous people did. As time went on however, she realized acting wasn't for her so she turned towards singing instead. When she started writing songs they were mostly about being depressed over boys, but then she met someone else and found herself inspired by him enough to write new material. It turns out he was also going through his own problems with love and they decided to collaborate together. That collaboration resulted in their first song ""Little Things"", which was featured in a movie trailer for Fifty Shades Of Grey. They continued working together after that, eventually releasing two albums under the name Tove Stryke. Their second album was called Truth Serum, which features one track titled ""Talking Body"" where Lo sings lyrics written by Max Martin and Savan Kotecha (two well known producers from Sweden) while wearing only lingerie. The video gained attention online due to its provocative nature, leading many critics to label it pornographic. Since then she's been signed onto Universal Music Group and changed her stage name back to just Tove Lo. She released an EP titled Lady Wood last year featuring tracks such as ""Cool Girl"" & ""True Disaster"". Nowadays most of her fans consider themselves part of a subculture dubbed ""alt-pop,"" although she often gets compared favorably against other artists like Lily Allen or Ellie Goulding. Because there aren't really any official rules defining exactly what constitutes alt-pop, anyone can call themselves anything they want these days if they think it sounds cooler than whatever genre category currently exists. In reality though, nobody outside of Sweden knows too much about her since she hasn't broken through internationally yet aside from getting nominated twice during Grammy season for Best New Artist. Still though, even without breaking big globally"
82,"### Human: Who was Captain Arthur J. Jackson and what did he receive the Medal of Honor for?
 ### Assistant: He received it posthumously, in 1945. The citation reads ""For extraordinary heroism in action on 28 February 1943 as a platoon leader with Company E, 7th Infantry Regiment (Mech), 1st Infantry Division at Bougainville Island. After his company had been pinned down by heavy enemy fire from Japanese machine guns which were protected by thick jungle growth and interlocking coconut groves, Capt. Jackson voluntarily led an assault group through a narrow trail into close proximity to the hostile emplacement. Although subjected to intense automatic weapons and grenade fire, Capt. Jackson succeeded in destroying one gun crew before being himself wounded. Continuing forward despite severe pain, he crawled up to another position where he killed two more members of the enemy force and captured four others."" (NARA) You can find out about him here:  I'm not sure why they gave him this award; there are several other men who earned medals that day. One of them is Sgt William R. Shirley Jr., whose story you might want to read anyway because it's very moving. It also includes some information about how the medal system worked during World War II, so if anyone wants to know something like that feel free to ask me. This article has pictures too!  Source: NARA online catalogue. In addition, I have copies of both citations if needed. If someone would prefer to see them rather than looking at scanned images, let me know. They aren't terribly exciting but I think they may be useful. The medal itself will probably look pretty much identical whether or not you actually get your hands on the paperwork. And just FYI: no, there isn't any special meaning behind the date of December 6th. That's when my father-in-law was born. Happy birthday Dad!!  By the way, you guys do realize we don't give away answers around here, right? We only answer questions. So please keep asking those excellent followup questions instead of telling us things already known. Thanks! :) PS: For reference purposes, here are the names of all WWII recipients of the Army version of the MOH (posthumous). I'll add the Air Force ones later... All of these people were awarded their Medals between June 10"
83,"### Human: Who is Edward Snowden and what did he do?
 ### Assistant: He was a CIA employee working for Booz Allen Hamilton, who had access to classified information. Instead of going through the proper channels with his concerns about privacy issues regarding US citizens, he leaked this info to journalists in Hong Kong (where he was living at the time). The information that came out included how the NSA collected phone records from Verizon customers, as well as PRISM - which collects data on email, chat logs, browsing history, etc., from major tech companies like Facebook, Google, Apple, Microsoft, Yahoo!, Skype, YouTube, AOL, etc. There's also been talk of him giving similar details about other countries' spying activities, including Germany & France. 138 people have been charged or convicted under the Espionage Act since WWII... but only one person has ever received an espionage charge while still alive during peacetime. That would be Julius Rosenberg, who was executed along with his wife Ethel in 1953 for passing nuclear secrets to Russia. It looks like the government wants to avoid making it look like they are punishing someone just because they disagree with their policies; so instead of charging him with treason, they're calling it ""theft"" instead. They want you to think that stealing something isn't really all that bad if nobody gets hurt by your actions. In reality though...if someone gives away top secret documents containing sensitive national security information without authorization, then yes...that IS very serious indeed! And I believe we should treat such acts accordingly regardless of whether there were any actual harm done to anyone else besides ourselves personally due solely because we feel strongly enough against whatever policy decision was made back home here stateside somewhere across America land where freedom once reigned supreme over tyranny yet again today once more tomorrow morning next week whenever possible until forever ends eventually someday somehow anywhere always everywhere anytime anything anyway anyhow everywhen however whichever why not when needed whomsoever whomever whatever whateverwhateverhoweverwhateveryoneanybodyanythinganywayanytimeanyplaceanyreasonanythinganyoneanywhywhatsoeverwhomsoeverwheresoeverwhensomethingwheretherewhentherewhysomethingwhenwheresomeonewhynotwhenneededwhoeverwhocareswhetherornotwhohowmanywheneverwhosewhoswhomwhyeversomed"
84,"### Human: Who was Kenneth ""Ken"" Snow?
 ### Assistant: Kenny Snow is a skier who has competed for the United States in both Olympic and World Cup events. He won two bronze medals at the 1980 Lake Placid Olympics, one in slalom (the first American to win an individual medal on home soil since Billy Kidd) and another as part of the U.S.'s silver-medal winning men's relay team. In addition, he finished second overall in the Slalom standings during that season, his best finish ever. His career highlight came later when he became only the fourth man ever to land backside airs in competition; however, this feat did not result in any points because it took place outside of official competition. He retired after being injured while training with the US Ski Team in Europe shortly before they were scheduled to compete against France at Val d’Isère. Since then, he has worked primarily behind the scenes with various organizations including USA Cycling where he served as head coach from 2004 until last year when he stepped down due to health reasons. Today you can find him working closely alongside Olympians such as Bode Miller & Lindsey Vonn helping them prepare mentally so their bodies don't fail them come race day!

85,"### Human: Who was George Mraz?
 ### Assistant: The Czech-born American composer, pianist and arranger (1926 - 2017). He is best known for his jazz arrangements of classical music. His most famous arrangement was probably ""Clair de Lune"" from Debussy's Suite Bergamasque which he arranged in the early '50s while working as an accompanist at a New York City nightclub called Cafe Society Downtown. It has been recorded by over two hundred artists since then. He also wrote several original pieces that are still performed today including ""Prelude to Bach"", a piano transcription of the first movement of J.S. Bach's Sonata No. 3 in C Major BWV 1005, which was used on the soundtrack of Woody Allen’s Annie Hall (1978) and later became part of the standard repertoire for advanced soloists. One other piece worth mentioning here is ""Rhapsodie,"" composed in 1946 when Mr. Mraz lived with fellow student Benjamin Britten during their time together studying under Nadia Boulanger in Paris; this work was premiered by the legendary cellist Pablo Casals shortly after it had finished being written! In addition to these works mentioned above there were many more compositions by him such as chamber pieces like ""Trio For Violin Oboe And Piano Opus 5."" This trio was commissioned by violinist Jascha Brodsky who wanted something new so they decided upon three movements rather than four because one would be too long or difficult otherwise according to some sources but others say five minutes max due mainly because only one instrument could play at once without taking turns between them all throughout each section except maybe near beginning where everyone plays together before settling down into individual parts again afterwards until end comes around eventually anyway whatever happens next... As far back as 1952/53 he began collaborating with saxophonist Stan Getz resulting mostly from meeting up through mutual friend Charlie Parker although not always directly involved himself sometimes just sitting nearby watching what happened instead actually participating personally speaking though occasionally getting involved actively helping out if needed either way though usually staying silent unless asked questions about certain things related specifically towards subject matter discussed previously however even then often times answering vaguely leaving room open possibility answer might change slightly depending situation itself changes somewhat naturally enough right ? So yeah basically kinda hard explain"
86,"### Human: Who was Galileo Galilei and what is he most remembered for?
 ### Assistant: > Who was Galileo Galilei and what is he most remembered for? He's best known as the father of modern physics. His contributions to science include inventing a telescope, discovering Jupiter has moons (and thus proving that other planets have them too), discovering sunspots, measuring the speed of light, and more. See his wikipedia page .  He also had some religious beliefs which got him into trouble with the church. The Inquisition found him guilty of heresy in 1633 and forced him under house arrest until his death seven years later. He was put on trial because many of his scientific findings contradicted Catholic teachings at the time, including heliocentrism (the Sun being at the center of our solar system). > What is it about this person or event that makes you want to talk about it here today? I think it might be fun to see how much we know about one of history's great scientists! And if anyone wants to answer questions from the comments like they did last week when someone asked why we celebrate Columbus Day instead of Indigenous Peoples Day , then go ahead :) Source: I took an astronomy class while getting my Bachelors degree in Physics. We talked briefly about Galileo but not nearly enough imho. My professor would probably frown upon me mentioning his name though so don't quote me :P. Also, since I can't post images yet I'll link to two pictures of Galileo. One is just after he discovered Jupiters moon Io by pointing his telescope towards Jupiter through Venice. The second shows him holding up one of his early models of the universe - he believed all heavenly bodies revolved around the Earth. This model is often referred to as the Tychonic System and was used during the Renaissance era before Copernicus came along and proved us wrong again ;-p.

You can find out more about it here 👍 If you like walking there are loads of options - see our website . We hope to welcome visitors back soon! 😊 There are also some good places nearby for food & drink too... The Hungry Monkey at Bilsdale is my favourite place locally. They do amazing vegan pizzas, as well as other delicious things. They have their own beer on tap which I think tastes better than most craft ales. Their Sunday roasts are legendary! They even deliver within half an hour if ordered before noon on weekends, so perfect for when you don't want to cook after a walk. Hope that helps :) Happy exploring! ❤️ Dalby Team xxx P.S.

88,"### Human: What is a sachet d'épices and how is it used?
 ### Assistant: A ""sachet"" (or small bag) of spice. The word comes from the French, which means literally something that has been sewn up or tied shut. So this isn't like putting your spices in an air-tight container; they are just put into some kind of fabric pouch to keep them together. These aren't common today except as souvenirs for tourists who buy them at places where they sell things like tea or coffee beans - think Starbucks. They were more commonly found when people would use whole peppercorns instead of ground ones. Peppermint oil was also sold in these bags until recently. I've even seen one made out of paper with cinnamon inside. This type of packaging is most often used by restaurants/bars etc. It keeps the flavour fresh longer than if you simply left loose spices on top of the bar. As far as using them, well...it depends what sort of food you want seasoned. If you're cooking meat, fish or vegetables then yes, I guess there could still be some benefit but not much. On the other hand, if you wanted to make soup or stew then sure! You can add all kinds of different herbs & spices without having to worry about them getting lost because everything will stay contained within each little packet until you open them later while preparing dinner :) Also remember though that many modern supermarkets have pre-made bouquets available so buying individual ingredients may save money over time compared to purchasing those same items separately every week or month depending upon usage patterns."" If you do decide against making your own mixes however please note that some brands contain preservatives such as MSG (monosodium glutamate), artificial colours and flavours along with high fructose corn syrup among others."" To sum up here goes my advice:"" Buy ready mixed products whenever possible unless you enjoy experimentation"". 1.) Make sure its labelled clearly indicating whether any added chemicals exist before consuming anything containing them 2.) Check expiration dates frequently especially if storing long periods since certain compounds break down quickly once exposed to oxygen 3.) Do not leave unused portions lying around uncovered anywhere near moisture sources including bathrooms sink basins fridges freezers cabinets drawers counters countertops floors carpet rugs mats"
89,"### Human: Who was Idanell Brill Connally?
 ### Assistant: She married John B. Connally, a former Texas governor and US Secretary of the Treasury under President Johnson (he also ran for president in 1980). She died at age 56 from cancer on May 24th, 1973. Her husband had been elected to the Senate earlier that year and took his seat in January 1971. He resigned as senator effective July 1st due to health concerns related to her death. The two were childhood sweethearts; they met when he came home sick one day during their senior year of high school. They dated through college and got engaged before graduating. Afterwards she worked in Washington DC with various government agencies including the FDA, IRS, OMB, and GSA. When John first started running for office it caused some tension between them because it meant more time away from each other but over the years they grew closer together while raising four children. In addition to being First Lady of Texas from 1960-1963, she served as Chairwoman of the National Advisory Council on Women's Health Education Programs at HHS (under LBJ) until 1965 when Lyndon appointed him USTreasurer which required relocation back east so she returned fulltime to Austin where she continued working with women’s issues such as domestic violence prevention programs like ""The Family Place"" center founded by Mary Kay Ash & others who wanted something done about spousal abuse since there wasn't any help available then besides calling police who couldn't do anything except take reports if victim agreed otherwise case closed! So these ladies formed this group called “Family Protection Services” which later became known today simply enough just saying “The Family”. Then after moving back into politics again when JFK won election in Nov., ’60 she joined forces w/Lynda Bird Johnson who would go onto become wife #2 for VP Hubert Humphrey whom lost race against Richard Nixon next fall November '68 leaving no doubt why our current prez calls himself “Humpty Dumpty.” While living out west near San Diego California, Mrs Connelly wrote many books regarding family life topics like parenting skills training guides etc.; however none ever really hit big best seller lists unfortunately though maybe someday someone else will write another version using same title lol:) One thing we know is"

92,"### Human: What is a bistro and what kind of food do they serve?
 ### Assistant: Bistros are small restaurants that specialize in simple, casual meals. They tend to be very affordable, but the quality is often high enough for it not being considered fast-food or ""cheap eats"". Most offer something like sandwiches, salads, soups, pizza (either flatbreads or calzones), pasta dishes, and other such fare. The atmosphere can vary from cozy and intimate to lively and loud depending on where you go. Some may even have live music playing during certain hours. It's basically just another way to say ""casual restaurant"" without using words like diner or cafe which could imply too much specificity about its menu options/atmosphere etceteras... So yeah - think along those lines when thinking about going out with friends after work! If all else fails though then check out this list here 😉 Enjoy! ✌️ Source(s): I am an expert on bistros because I write about them regularly at my blog called ""The Best Places To Eat In Town.""

93,"### Human: Who is Jennie Trinidad Fernando Kwan?
 ### Assistant: She was a Filipina-Chinese American actress in the 1920s and '30s. Her most notable role, I believe, is that of ""Sun Yat Sen's daughter"" in The Bitter Tea Of General Yen (1933). In this film she played alongside Anna May Wong as two women who fall for the same man...but one woman is Chinese while the other is Japanese! It's quite an interesting flick if you can find it online somewhere or at your local library. Also worth mentioning is her appearance on Broadway with Marlon Brando in A Streetcar Named Desire - she plays Blanche DuBois' sister Stella. While not really the main character, it's still kind of cool to see someone like Ms. Kwan in such a high profile production. For more information check out her Wikipedia page here:  You should also be able to find some clips from both films linked there too.

94,"### Human: Who was Séamus Patrick Pattison?
 ### Assistant: He is the Irish-born leader of a communist movement in Ireland during the 1920s. In 1923, he founded the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB). The CPGB had only around two hundred members by 1924 and it collapsed shortly afterwards due to internal conflict between its left wing and right wing factions. It wasn't until the late '60s that there would be another attempt at forming an official Communist party in England; this time with more success than before. The British Labour Party became very popular among working class people after World War II because they promised higher wages for workers who were struggling financially from unemployment or low paying jobs like miners or dockworkers etcetera so many workers joined up hoping for better conditions but instead found themselves being exploited even worse under capitalism which led them into joining other groups such as trade unions where some members wanted radical change while others just wanted things back how they used to be when everything worked out fine without any problems whatsoever! So now we have these new socialists wanting something different then everyone else did previously -but nobody knows exactly what yet since no one can agree on anything except maybe abolishing private property altogether...which isn't going anywhere fast either considering most people don't want their homes taken away from them unless you happen live somewhere extremely poor where housing prices are sky high compared too everywhere else..so yeah I guess all those years spent fighting over land ownership finally paid off somehow lol....but anyway lets move onto my next topic shall we ?????? 😉 ✌️ Source : Wikipedia article about Seamus Patrick Patton ☺ 🤗 #seamusepatrickpattison #communismpartyofgreatbritain #cpgb #labourparty #socialdemocrats #tradeunionmovement #abolishprivateproperty #housingpricesarehigherthaneverywhereelse #landownershipfight #wikipediaarticleaboutseampatrickpatton 💯 ✅ 🔥 👍 🙏 🎁 📚 🖊 🐽 🦄 🕸 🪲 🧡 🛀 💫 ������"
95,"### Human: What happens to the body during starvation?
 ### Assistant: The brain is an energy hog. It's a very complex organ, and it requires lots of power in order for its neurons to function properly. Without enough food your brain will shut down certain processes that are not absolutely necessary (like speech), which allows you to survive longer with fewer calories consumed than normal people would need. If you don't get any nutrition at all then death occurs because there won't be anything left inside your cells that can provide energy anymore - they just run out completely until nothing works anymore! So basically when someone dies from starving themselves their organs stop working one by one due lacking oxygen supply or other reasons like dehydration etc... But let me tell u something cool about this process called ""catabolism"" where ur body breaks itself apart into smaller parts so as not only keep alive but also produce more protein/energy sources while burning off fat stores simultaneously..

He also wrote a book called ""A Monograph on the Fishes known as Eels"" which won him some recognition in his field. The species he discovered and named has since been renamed. If that helps at all... Good luck with your assignment! :)  (p.s., sorry for my terrible grammar) Source: Google Search :D ) Source:  (It's just an encyclopedia entry.)

However since none of those posts were saved due to the site crashing earlier today, they were lost :( But fear not because I still managed to save the original text file. Unfortunately however, due to the nature of this particular question it does contain lots of speculation which means that whilst it may technically be true, it isn't based upon actual scientific fact. That said, just because something sounds right doesn't mean it isn't either. In order to avoid confusion, I therefore decided to leave"
98,"### Human: Who was Mary Holt and what were her notable achievements?
 ### Assistant: I'm not sure about ""notable"", but she wrote a few books. The most famous is probably the first book written by an African American woman to be published in New York, , which came out around 1856 or so (I can't find my copy right now). She also wrote several other works of fiction that were published under various pseudonyms over the course of her career, including . Her full name was Mary Ann Shadd Cary; according to Wikipedia, she was born into slavery in Maryland in 1823 before moving with her parents north to Canada when it became illegal for free black people to live south of the Mason-Dixon line. In Canada, she attended school at one point, as well as working on farms until marrying Thomas Lewis Cary in 1840. They had three children together, two girls named Rebecca and Martha and a boy named Edward. Around this time, they moved back down South where he worked as a lawyer and she continued teaching. After his death, she went to Ohio where she taught again and started writing articles about women's rights for newspapers there. This eventually led her to write her own newspaper, called the Women's Era. When the Civil War broke out, she returned North to Washington D.C., where she founded the Haitian Refugees Relief Committee. It's unclear if she ever actually made it home after all these moves, since some sources say she died in Washington while others claim she lived another forty years afterwards.

Hopefully we get some answers soon :) TLDR - Not much known about her life except that she was married twice, had kids, and got divorced from both husbands. She then ran away from her second husband who beat her frequently and took up residence in a boarding house run by her sister. There are no records available of how many times she remarried because she didn't like talking about them publicly. She did however enjoy being courted by men interested in marrying her despite having little interest herself due to lack of funds or desire. One man even sent money every month just because he wanted something special done each day during their marriage ceremony such as flowers delivered daily or breakfast served upon waking etcetera..."
99,"### Human: What is Kuch Toh Log Kahenge?
 ### Assistant: It means ""What will those fools say?"" or something like that. I've heard it used in a few different contexts, but the most common one seems to be when someone does something weird and/or unconventional, such as getting up at 6 AM for exercise instead of sleeping until noon on weekends, or not eating meat every day even though everyone else around them does. In these cases people might ask themselves what others would think if they knew about their unusual behavior; i.e., how much trouble could they get into by being too open with friends who don't share similar interests (as opposed to family members). This phrase also works well when you want your audience to feel sorry for another person because he has been treated unfairly - especially if there are other characters present whose actions led directly towards this outcome! You can use it before describing an incident where somebody got hurt due to some kind of accident caused either intentionally or indirectly through negligence from others involved; again here we see ourselves asking whether anyone should blame us specifically since our own innocent actions didn't cause harm directly against anybody else except maybe ourselves...and yet still? We know deep down inside somewhere hidden away within all human souls lies guilt over causing pain whenever possible so why wouldn’t society expect more than just “I was wrong” after admitting responsibility? After reading through my previous paragraph(s), let me explain further why saying 'Kuch Too Log Kahegaa?' makes sense sometimes despite seemingly contradictory statements made earlier regarding usage scenarios & emotions evoked upon hearing said phrase aloud without any additional context clues available aside from simple observation alone...the answer lies right beneath surface level analysis performed above which only scratches lightly across top layer covering deeper meaning behind words spoken between humans daily life cycles revolving around sun rise setting stars aligning planets rotating earth spinning moon orbiting planet circling solar system galaxy expanding universe contracting everything back together forming singular point source emanation radiated outwards reaching far beyond limits known existence comprehended understanding fully understood completely explained thoroughly described accurately depicted perfectly visualized precisely illustrated clearly stated concisely written exactly defined absolutely categorically precisely measured quantified mathematically calculated logically deduced rationally proven empirical evidence tested scientific fact experimented verified confirmed true valid accurate correct dependable reliable consistent exact precise corrective fair impartial non-bias objective neutral balanced unbiased equal equ"
