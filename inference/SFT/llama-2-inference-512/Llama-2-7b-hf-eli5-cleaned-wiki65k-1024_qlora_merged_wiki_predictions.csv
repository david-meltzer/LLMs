0,"### Human: What is the purpose of the 7.62 x 39mm cartridge?
 ### Assistant: The 7.62x39mm (also known as 7.62 Soviet or simply .30 Russian) is a rifle round designed in Russia and used by many former Warsaw Pact countries, such as Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, Albania and others. It was made to be an intermediate-range rifle caliber that would combine good range with low cost ammunition. This makes it useful for use against lightly armored vehicles like tanks but not powerful enough to penetrate most heavy armor. Its ballistics are similar to those of NATO's 5.56×45mm and its bullet diameter matches US military M1 Carbine rounds, which allows the Soviets to make their own magazines using old American surplus parts. Because of this, it has been called ""The People's Cartridge"". Most modern versions can fire tracer bullets, incendiaries, explosive bullets, or subsonic bullets for suppressed firing. However, it does have some disadvantages. For example, because of its high muzzle velocity, accuracy at long ranges drops off quickly. Also, due to being one of the cheapest rifles ever created, quality control on AKM/AK-47 series guns can sometimes leave them unreliable. There were also reports from Iraq War veterans about how they had trouble getting accurate shots past 80 meters when shooting targets downwind, even though these weapons could hit moving targets out to over 300m. Despite all this, however, the weapon remains popular among third world militaries around the globe despite having been replaced in most places by newer assault rifles chambered in more advanced calibers. Aside from its original designation as an infantry rifle, it continues to serve today as a designated marksman rifle and sniper rifle thanks to its large magazine capacity combined with relatively cheap price tag compared to other designs such as FN SCAR or Barrett MRAD. In addition, since the end of World War II until recently there wasn’t any other rifle capable of killing humans effectively beyond 100 yards except for bolt action rifles so this was considered adequate back then too! Today we see less need for such extreme distances given better optics available nowadays but still remain relevant if you want something reliable without breaking"

 ### Assistant: David ""Dave"" Sims (born 1957) is a British radio and television presenter. He was born in London, England on April Fool's Day, but grew up in the south of Scotland. After leaving school he worked as a reporter for BBC Radio Borders before moving to BBC Radio Cumbria where his career began with breakfast shows, then weekend evenings, followed by weekday drivetime slots. In 2008, after being awarded 'Best Regional Breakfast Show Presenter', Sims joined talkSPORT as part of their new national drive-time show alongside Andy Goldstein. The pair were replaced during February 2013 by Colin Murray and Jason Mohammad when they moved across from BBC Radio Five Live. During June 2014 it was announced that both would be returning to Five Live to host an early evening sports programme, called Sportsweek. On 6 May 2015, it was confirmed that the duo had been sacked by Five Live following allegations of bullying. They returned to talkSPORT later that month, hosting the station's afternoon show between 1pm - 4pm each day until November 2016.

2,"### Human: What was the name of the French colony that later became the Republic of Dahomey?
 ### Assistant: The Colony of Porto-Novo (, ) was a French colony. It is now part of Benin in West Africa. From 1904 to 1958 it was called the Territory of Porto-Novo and from 1960 until its dissolution in August 1975 it was known as the Republic of Dahomey. History 
Porto-Novo started out as an important trading post for slaves and gold between Europeans and Africans. In 1832, France took over control of what had been the Kingdom of Allada. This kingdom lasted only eight years before being conquered by another African nation. Portugal retook this area in 1842 but gave up all claims on it when they signed their treaties with Britain at the end of the Crimean War. Afterwards, the French built a fort there which led to them taking more land around the coastal region. They created two colonies; one near Ouidah and one closer to Lagos. Both were named after the ports where ships docked regularly during slaving times. One of these colonies was Porto-Novo while the other was called Cotonou or Côte d'Ivoire today. In 1853, both colonies joined together under one governorship based in Abidjan, Ivory Coast. By 1870, however, cotton farming began growing rapidly due to new technology making production easier than ever before so people moved away from slave labor into plantations instead. As such, many villages disappeared altogether because no longer needed any workers anymore since machines could do everything themselves without anyone else involved except maybe some extra help here or there if necessary. Thus leading us back full circle again! Today we see how much things have changed compared against those days long ago... But wait... There's still plenty left unexplored yet - let me tell you about my next adventure down below!...

3,"### Human: What is the name and some characteristics of a moon of Saturn?
 ### Assistant: Daphnis (, ) or , also known as S/2005 S1, is a moon of Saturn. It was found in 2005 by Scott Sheppard, David Jewitt, Jan Kleyna, and Brian G. Marsden using data from Cassini spacecraft. It has an orbital period of about six days around its parent planet at an inclination of about 43° to the ecliptic plane (the same as that of Mimas). Its diameter is approximately . The surface gravity on this small body is very low, only 6% that of Earth's. This means it would be easy for people to walk there with their own weight. However, due to its low density, which may be less than one tenth that of water ice, they could not lift off again without help. In addition, the temperature varies greatly between daytime highs near freezing point and night-time lows below -290 °C (-478 °F), making life uncomfortable even if air pressure were normal. Because of these problems, Daphnis cannot support any form of human habitation. A more likely use for Daphnis might be mining, where robots are used instead of humans. There are many other moons orbiting close to larger bodies like Jupiter and Saturn; all have much higher densities so can hold onto atmosphere better. They do however suffer from radiation damage caused by solar wind particles hitting them hard enough to break up atoms into nuclei and electrons. As well as this problem being serious for anything living on such worlds because they lose heat quickly when exposed directly to sunlight or star light rather than reflected away through clouds etc., another major factor limiting colonization efforts will always remain: distance! These faraway planets take years just travelling back & forth across vast distances before ever reaching each others gravitational pulls strong enough over time periods needed build settlements & make homes stable enough last long term without falling apart under constant stress induced wear & tear every passing week since arrival date first landed there until now today...

4,"### Human: What is the Rambla de las Ovejas and where is it located?
 ### Assistant: The Rambla de las Ovejas (Sheep's Rampart) is a ridge in Seville, Spain. It was built by King Alfonso X of Castile to defend his city from the Moors who were living on the other side of the river Guadalquivir. History 
In September 1248, the Almohad army led by Yusuf I al-Mustansir invaded Andalusia with an army made up of over 30,000 men. They crossed into the province of Huelva through the Sierra Morena mountains. Then they headed for Sevilla which had only about 750 soldiers at that time. On October 6th they arrived before the walls of Sevilla. They attacked the city but could not get inside because the king ordered all bridges across the Guadalquivir River be destroyed so the enemy would have no way of crossing the river. He also sent orders to burn down every house near the river bank. This created a fire wall along the banks of the river. After this the shepherds started bringing their sheep closer to the river hoping to escape if needed. Soon there was such a large herd of sheep that they formed a barrier between the Muslims and the Christian defenders. When the shepherds saw the danger coming they ran away leaving their flock behind as protection against any attackers. In this way the ""Ramblea"" or Sheepshield was born. The name came from the fact that these animals served as a natural defense system until reinforcements arrived. According to the historian Gonzalo Ruiz Manjón-Cabeza de Vaca, the battle lasted seven days. During those days many battles took place in different places around the city. Finally the Christians won after the arrival of the reinforcement troops commanded by King Ferdinand III of Castille and Leon. One of them was his brother Henry II of Portugal. Some historians claim that the victory was due more to luck than good military strategy. But whatever happened the outcome was favorable for the Kingdom of Castilla and León. From then on the kingdom of Sevillia belonged to the Christians. Since the beginning of the 19th century people began using the term ""Rampa del Asno"" instead of ""Rampa de Las Ovejas"". Today you can still see some remains of what used to be part of the"
5,"### Human: What is an anvil used for?
 ### Assistant: An anvil (or anvils) are tools that blacksmiths use. It can be a large piece of metal, usually iron or steel, which they put things on to shape them by hammering and heat treatment techniques such as welding. The word ""anvil"" comes from the Latin word anguilla, meaning eel-shaped because it looks like one. Blacksmiths also call their workshop where they make items out of metal an anvil shop. In most cases, there will only be one anvil in any given smithy but sometimes two might share space together. There was even a time when three anvils were found side by side at some shops! This made more room available so many different projects could go forward simultaneously without having too much clutter around each other's working area(s). If you ever find yourself looking into purchasing your very first set up for making things out of metals then know this; if possible try getting both sides done before putting anything else inside since those pieces tend not being able take all sorts shapes due how hardened steel gets cold quickly once exposed air touches its surface while hot enough temperatures still remain present within itself despite cooler temps surrounding outside environment conditions changing constantly over course few minutes passed between starting point ending stage completion process finish line final step completed successfully achieved smoothly seamlessly effortless manner flawlessly faultlessly free flowing freely fluidity movement motion speed stability steadiness solidarity sturdiness strength tenacity toughness durability durable quality long lasting longevity lifetimes years decades centuries millennia epochs ages eras periods times frames cycles phases stages steps procedures processes methods measures standards rules laws regulations restrictions limitations barriers obstacles hurdles bumps potholes detours distractions interruptions delays disasters calamities catastrophic events cataclysms tragedies tragical incidents horrific occurrences ghastly situations awful predicaments dire circumstances deplorable circumstances grim scenarios gloomy atmospheres melancholic moods somber settings dark clouds storms hurricanes typhoons cyclones tornadoes blizzards snowstorms ice storms hailstorms floods earthquakes volcanos lava explosions fires conflagrations blazes burnings flames ignitions combustion burning down destruction devouring ruin annihilation obliter"

8,"### Human: Who is King Kong and what is his role in movies and other media?
 ### Assistant: King Kong (; ) is a fictional giant monster who first appeared in the 1932 movie of the same name. He has been featured several times since, including sequels to both the original film and its remake. The character was created by Merian C. Cooper and Edgar Wallace. In early films he is portrayed as an enormous gorilla-like beast. Later versions are more anthropomorphic with an upright posture and human hands instead of fingers. This version became known for wearing a loincloth and armband. For some years after World War II, most adaptations were musicals or comedies. However, beginning in the late 1970s many new dramatic movies have used him. These include Peter Jackson's 2005 adaptation where he appears much larger than ever before on screen. Most recent stories treat him sympathetically and see humans as responsible for his actions. They also present him as having intelligence and emotions similar to those of people. A live action television series featuring him began airing in October 2006. It ran until March 8th, 2008. As well as this, there was another television show that focused around King Kong titled Tales Of The Golden Monkey which lasted from September 4th, 1966 through April 2nd, 1968.

11,"### Human: What is the format of MPEG-1 and/or MPEG-2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)?
 ### Assistant: The Moving Picture Experts Group developed two formats for audio compression. These are called MPEG-1 and MPEG-2 Audio Layer 3, or MP3. This page describes both formats. Format overview 
The main idea behind these formats is to take a sound signal which has many frequencies in it that we don't need much detail about, and compress them into something smaller without losing too much information from those parts of the song where there aren't so many high frequency sounds. There are some other ideas as well but this one is pretty important. For example when you hear someone singing, most of what they sing isn't very high pitched. If you have an mp3 player with a small memory, then if all your songs were just lots of screams at full volume, your mp3 player would not be able to store anything else on it because everything would use up its entire capacity. So instead the person who makes the music takes out all the low level bits and leaves only the higher levels ones, and uses a lot more space than needed to do that. Then he sends his file to another guy whose job is to make sure no bit was left unused by accident. He looks through every part of the data stream, and decides whether each piece should be compressed even further, until finally the whole thing gets put together again. It can also happen that people change things around inside their own files - like taking a really long instrumental solo, and cutting off the beginning halfway through. In this case the original programmers may decide later that it doesn't matter how the extra stuff got cut away, since nobody will notice anyway. They might simply delete any remaining references to the first few minutes of the song before sending it back out to everybody. Now here comes somebody else who wants to listen to the same song but on his computer rather than using headphones while jogging. His software needs to know exactly what order the different pieces go in, otherwise it won't play the right notes! That's why the end result must always include enough information about itself that anybody could reconstruct the original sound wave perfectly given access to the raw data. The final step is done automatically whenever possible; sometimes though humans get involved manually depending upon how big the changes made during editing were relative to the total size of the new version being produced. You see? It works kinda like making popcorn except way harder. And yes I know technically speaking MP4"

On November 30, 2008, President George Bush visited the hall to give a speech about immigration reform. He became the first sitting president to do so since Harry S. Truman did so at Constitution Hall in Washington D.C. in June 1950. On March 20, 2009, Barack Obama gave his second inaugural address there after winning re-election to the Presidency. After this event, he said that music played a big role in his life growing up because he loved listening to jazz records with his mother while she cooked dinner. During the pandemic, many people have taken advantage of virtual tours available online. One such tour can be found here . 
On July 7, 2022, the concert hall suffered minor damage during a power outage caused by heat waves across Southern California; no one was injured but several instruments were damaged. A spokesperson stated that all events scheduled between now through August would not take place due to repairs needed from the incident. Repair work began immediately afterwards.

15,"### Human: What is the name of the church in the Vasastaden district in Stockholm?
 ### Assistant: Stora Sköndal Church () or Great Sköndal Church (), was a church building in the Vasastaden district in central Stockholm. It was built by architects Cyrillus Johansson and Carl Westman during 1895–1896, as part of a new parish that had been created on January 24, 1893. The foundation stone was laid down at April 27, 1895, with King Oscar II present. In 1905 it became an independent parish under its own rector. In 1910 the church got its first organ. On June 20, 1936, a fire broke out in the church tower, destroying most of the roof. Reconstruction started immediately but took more than ten years to complete. During this time the congregation met in other churches while waiting for reconstruction to finish. This meant that there were no services from July 1936 until February 1947. When it was finally finished again, it had lost some of its original features. Today, the church has become one of many which are used only rarely. There have also been plans to demolish it because of lack of use. But the church will be renovated instead, according to plan since summer 2012. A project group led by Kjellander + Sjöberg Architects have made suggestions about how they would like the church to look after restoration work is done. The cost for these works is estimated to SEK 3 million ($450,000). Restoration should start before Easter 2015, when the church celebrates 120th anniversary. If everything goes well, the restored church could open in autumn/winter 2016-17. Source:

 ### Assistant: Ben Shepherd (born 5 June, 1967) was born and raised in Seattle. He plays bass guitar for grunge band Soundgarden. The band had their first hit with ""Black Hole Sun"" from the album Superunknown which went to #2 on Billboard's Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. They also released a cover of Chris Cornell song called ""Like A Stone"". It reached number one on the Adult Top 40 radio charts. In May 2018 it was announced that he will be joining Stone Temple Pilots as they continue touring after Chester Bennington died by suicide in July 2017.

19,"### Human: Who was Hōjō Masako married to and what were her children's names?
 ### Assistant: , also known as Princess Sadako, was the daughter of Emperor Go-Daigo. She became Empress after marrying Minamoto no Sanetomo in 1295. Her name before marriage is not recorded. After his father died she married again with Yasutoki who later became Shogun Ashikaga Takauji (Ashikaga Takaudai). Their two sons were Yoritoki and Morotoki. In 1308 their son Yoriyoshi became a Monk named Jōchō. The other son Moroyo died at age fourteen from smallpox. This made Yoshiaki heir apparent but when Yoriyuki became ill they decided that Kujō Michihira would be next in line for shogunal power. He eventually succeeded his brother as shogun under the regency of his uncle, the retired shogun Yoriie. His mother lived until 1346 when she took Buddhist vows. Her remains are buried on Mount Koya. There has been some controversy about whether or not there actually was an emperor by this time called Go-Sadahito because it may have only been a title given to him since he had no male descendants. Another possibility is that Prince Kanenari of the Imperial Household Agency might have been referred to as ""Emperor"" during these years even though he never held any real political authority. If so then he could have become the last legitimate member of the imperial family before being overthrown by the Kamakura bakufu. Some historians believe that Emperor Go-Fukakusa was the last true monarch while others argue that Go-Daigo himself remained alive into the Muromachi period. What happened between them will probably always remain unknown although most scholars agree that something did happen around this point which caused Japan's history to change forever. It seems likely however that if anything does survive today we should look toward Kyushu where many artifacts still exist including shrines dedicated solely to him. One example can be seen near Miyazaki City Hall where you will find statues representing both past rulers such as Emperor Go-Daigo along side present day figures like Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. These monuments serve reminder us just how much influence Japanese culture continues to hold onto despite centuries worth changes taking place across Asia Pacific region itself.

20,"### Human: What is a domain name and what are some common domain name extensions?
 ### Assistant: A domain name (or web address) is the text that people type into their computers to get online. Domain names use alphanumeric characters such as numbers, letters or special symbols. For example, the domain name for this website is . The most commonly used top-level domains include .com,.org, and .net. Other types of domains have been created in recent years. These include country code TLDs like , and generic Top Level Domains (gTLD). Some examples of gTLD's are .biz, .info, .mobi, .travel, etc.. There are also other domains which do not end with an extension. An example would be , which uses IPv6 addresses instead of using the normal DNS system. It is important to note however that these sites will only work if you know how to access them via IPv6. Many websites still only support IPv4, so accessing those sites through your router may cause problems due to having two different protocol versions being sent at once.  The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), keeps track of all internet domain names. They make sure there aren’t any conflicts between registrants who want similar names but live far apart from each other; they also ensure that nobody else can register another company called “Microsoft” after Microsoft has already registered its own domain name! ICANN does charge fees for managing these records though—the cost depends on whether it’s just one person wanting his/her own site up quickly versus multiple companies trying out new ideas together before deciding where best suits everyone involved.” This means that while anyone could theoretically buy up every possible combination available under certain conditions, doing so wouldn’t actually provide much value unless someone wanted specifically something along those lines anyway."" If we were talking about physical real estate then maybe yes —but since there isn’t really anything stopping us from getting more land somewhere nearby later down line then why bother now?”
The most popular domain name ending is probably ""dot com"" followed closely behind by "".net"". However many others exist including ""dot org"", ""dot biz,""and even ""dot info"" depending upon what kind of business needs help fulfilling yours!
There are over 10 million active websites worldwide today according to Netcraft statistics. As technology advances further into our daily lives expect this number grow exponentially over time too! So don’t forget about adding yourself onto list when looking around next week"
21,"### Human: What is a shotgun and how does it work?
 ### Assistant: A Shotgun or Double barrel gun (also called an ""over-and-under"") is a type of firearm. It fires two shots at once from the same barrels, one after another. The first shell goes out through the muzzle end with the second shell coming out of the breech on top of it. This means that there are no moving parts in between each firing cycle except for the trigger pull. The most common way to load these guns is by using shotshells which have been loaded into either side of their chamber beforehand so all you need do is slide them down until they reach where your fingers would be if holding onto both sides simultaneously while pulling backward slightly toward yourself then forward again when reloading next time around; this method works best because bullets cannot fit inside chambers without being broken apart first due mainly due lack space available within said area since opening up even more room could cause damage during discharge process itself! 
This makes sense why some people choose not use magazines instead magazine fed weapons like rifles etc.. But still others prefer having lots ammo stored away somewhere else just in case something happens unexpectedly causing malfunction issues arise suddenly requiring immediate attention otherwise bad things happen fast sometimes resulting death injury serious consequences occur frequently enough over years gone past now present future uncertain events ahead unknown yet unforeseen occurrences take place leaving behind lasting effects forevermore affecting everyone involved directly indirectly negatively positively neutralizing positive negative neutrally remaining static status quo unaffected outcome undecided conclusion determined result final verdict judgement jury duty penalty punishment imprisonment incarceration confinement detention arrest warrant wanted fugitive hiding criminal behavior immoral illegal illicit wrongful unlawful lawless abnormal unusual weird strange odd peculiar eccentric crazy insane craziness nuts mania psychosis schizophrenia delusional hallucination paranoid schizo borderline personality disorder PTSD post traumatic stress syndrome depression anxiety phobias panic attacks suicidal tendencies self harm addiction substance dependency alcoholism drug dependence smoking marijuana weed pot cannabis cocaine crack heroin opium morphine codeine fentanyl oxycodone hydrocodone tramadol valium xanax klonopin lorazepam diazepam zolpidem amb"

28,"### Human: What is the size range of the Oaxacan cloud forest tree frog?
 ### Assistant: The Oaxacan cloud forest tree frog (Dendropsophus ossilaginis) is a species of frog. It lives in Mexico and Guatemala. Scientists saw it on mountains between 1603 to 2589 meters above sea level, but they think that this frog could live up to 3400 meters high. Adult males are about 7.4 cm long from nose to rear end; adult females are slightly larger than males at around 7.5 cm. This frog has light brown skin with dark spots or blotches all over its body. There may be some white markings near each eye and there can also be yellow coloring behind the eyes. Its belly is paler colored. This frogs tongue is pale pinkish-brown. These frogs have webbed feet. They lay their eggs underwater. When these tadpoles hatch out into larvae, they swim away quickly because predators like fish eat them when they stay still for too long. After three weeks as a tadpole, the young frogs climb onto land where they grow legs and turn into frogs. Frogs that spend more time living in trees will develop bigger toe discs which help them climb better. In captivity, these frogs need warm temperatures, humidity levels of around 70% and good quality food such as crickets every day. At night, you should cover your tank so that they don't jump out if scared by noise outside! You might want to put some plants inside too since amphibians love hiding places. Be careful not to use any chemicals though - even natural ones like insecticides harm frogs just like anything else does. If possible try using organic fertilisers instead - worm castings work well here! Fungi gnats tend to breed easily indoors during winter months due to lack of sunlight exposure causing mould growth along walls etc., which attracts other bugs who then feed off those things making an infestation happen very fast indeed... So make sure everything stays clean before introducing new animals into enclosure otherwise problems arise rapidly. Last thing worth mentioning would be how much space needs providing per individual animal depending upon age/size group concerned - generally speaking smaller individuals require less room than older specimen types however keep in mind these factors vary wildly based"

33,"### Human: What is Bulgogi and where does it originate from?
 ### Assistant: Bulgogi (Korean: 불고기) means ""fire meat"" or ""meat that grilled"". It comes from the Korean word for fire, which is 'bul'. The term bulgogi was first used in a cookbook called Samguk Yusa by Kim Busik. He wrote about how to make beef bulgogi in his book during Goryeo Dynasty of Korea. In modern times, this dish has become very popular throughout Asia. There are many different types of recipes with various ingredients such as onion, garlic and ginger added into it depending upon region or personal preference. This delicious food can also be served cold if desired instead of hot so people who don't like spicy things may enjoy eating it too! Most restaurants serve this meal along side other traditional Korean favorites including kimchi soup (kimchijeon), bibimbap bowl rice mixed vegetables seaweed rolls etc.. Some places even offer bbq versions using charcoal barbecue sticks rather than gas burners because they believe these produce better flavor results when cooking over low heat longer periods time compared against regular electric heaters which tend burn faster higher temperatures shorter durations. So whether you prefer your bulgogi sweet salty sour or whatever else suits taste buds best rest assured there will always something available satisfy cravings no matter what kind day had been having lately!
There are two main types of Bulgogi. One type uses thin strips of marinated beef; another consists mostly of thicker cuts of pork belly or shoulder. Both have their own unique flavors but both use similar methods for preparation. These include cutting pieces across grains then searing quickly before adding seasonings such as sesame oil salt pepper sugar vinegar chili powder red peppers flakes chopped green onions etc... Finally after everything combined together slowly simmer until tender juices run clear through center of each piece ensuring maximum flavor development without becoming dry tough textures. Once ready place onto serving plates top off with additional sauces/toppings according individual preferences. Then sit back relax enjoy knowing deliciously prepared meals await ahead every step way journey takes towards fulfillment ultimate goal satisfaction hungry appetite needs desires wishes wants dreams aspirations hopes ambitions goals"

 ### Assistant: Vermont (; ) is a state in the northeastern United States. It was one of the original 13 colonies that formed the United States. The capital city, Montpelier, has about 7,800 people and is located near Lake Champlain on the north end of the Green Mountains. About half of all Vermonters live within an hour's drive from this town. Other cities include Burlington to the southwest along Lake Champlain, Brattleboro to the west between Mount Snow and the Connecticut River, Rutland at the foot of Killington Mountain in central Vermont, and St. Johnsbury in the northern part of the state. Bennington is famous as the site where Ethan Allen led his Green Mountain Boys against British troops during the American Revolutionary War. Today it hosts annual reenactments of the Battle of Bennington. In 2005, Vermont became the first U.S. state with universal health care when Governor Peter Shumlin signed Act 48 into law. Vermont is also home to some of America's oldest ski resorts such as Stratton Mountain Resort which opened in 1961 and Mad River Glen Ski Area founded by Ernest Moulton in 1947. Both are still family-owned today. The University of Vermont in Burlington has been ranked among ""America’s Best Colleges"" by Forbes magazine every year since they began surveying colleges in 2005 except once - when they were not surveyed due to COVID-related concerns.. Aside from being a college town itself there are several other nearby towns like Middlebury College Town or Lyndonville that have thriving downtown areas because students shop locally instead of going out onto Interstate 89 towards larger shopping centers further away like Williston or Essex Junction just outside Burlington City Limits.. This means more money stays local so business owners can afford higher wages than what most chain stores offer their employees resulting in lower turnover rates amongst staff members who tend stay longer if paid well enough while working less hours per week due fewer customers coming through doors each day compared say those found inside Walmart Supercenter locations throughout North America where shoppers often find themselves fighting crowds amidst chaotic traffic jams caused solely by lack proper parking spaces available close proximity store fronts..

36,"### Human: What is the title and artist of the painting ""Ideal Landscape with a Young Man Killing a Snake""?
 ### Assistant: Ideal Landscape with a Young Man Killing a Snake (; ) is an oil on canvas painting by Dutch painter Jan van Goyen. It was painted between 1645–1670 in Amsterdam, Netherlands. The painting measures . The painting shows two figures atop a rocky outcropping looking over what appears to be rolling hills dotted with trees and farm buildings below. On one side are mountains, while on the other there are fields full of grazing sheep and cattle. A young man armed with bow and arrow stands next to his horse on top of the rocks shooting down at a snake that he has just struck with his arrows. The snake writhes beneath him as it attempts to strike back or flee from its attacker. There is also another figure standing nearby who may have been watching this event unfold. This work is signed and dated lower left corner J. v G. fecit / Anno 1649 (""Jan van Goyen made [this] in the year 1649""). The date seems wrong for Van Goyen's career because the style does not match any period within his life but rather resembles works done during Rembrandt's lifetime when both artists were still alive together around 1638-1642. In fact, some scholars believe that they worked closely enough so much so that their styles became similar even though neither ever acknowledged each others existence publicly until after death had taken them away forever.""
The painting was sold twice before being bought again shortly afterwards by Sir John Soane's Museum London England UK which holds possession today under license agreement since April 1st 1812 through December 31st 1975 whereupon ownership reverted back into private hands once more according Wikipedia page listing owner details listed herewith permission granted by copyright holder Mr Mark Dunnell whose name can easily found online via Google search engine if desired further information please contact us directly via email address provided above thank you very kindly indeed!

That project is currently being written right now though there are no details about who else might star or if any other actors besides Jackman have signed up yet. In December 2018, Sony Pictures Entertainment decided not make anymore movies based off of the Van Helsing franchise after they had trouble getting funded because studios didn’t want anything related to Marvel Studios due to them having problems with their own films like Spider-Man Homecoming (2017). On May 14th 2019 it was revealed that Universal Pictures bought back rights over all three previous installments along with new ones including an animated series produced by Robert Zemeckis's ImageMovers Digital Studio alongside Blur Studio; these projects were later cancelled before production began following Disney buying out Fox earlier same year causing more delays than ever seen previously before involving Van Helsing property itself even though some sources say company still plans release sometime around late 2019/early 2020 depending how things go next month once everything gets sorted out between both parties involved here..

He was one of the leaders of the 2014–present Umbrella Movement and other recent pro-democracy movements. In December 2018 he won the International Children's Peace Prize for advocating human rights for children around the world. Life
Wong was born on 13 October 1996 to an ethnic Chinese family who immigrated to Australia when he was three years old. His mother died in March 2015 at age forty due to breast cancer. She had been diagnosed with it two months before she gave birth to him. After graduation from high school, he returned to live permanently in Hong Kong where he studied law at Lingnan University. As a student leader there, he helped organize protests against government plans to increase tuition fees by up to four times their current levels. These were called ""the fishball riots"". The police arrested dozens of students including Wong himself during these protests. But they later dropped all charges after deciding that many of them did not break any laws. This event made more people aware of Wong as a political figure. Soon afterwards, he joined the Scholarism group which organized another large demonstration. It was about changes planned for how candidates are elected to be Chief Executive of Hong Kong. Wong said this would make democratic elections impossible because only Beijing could approve or reject each candidate put forward by the public. During these events, Wong met some of the other key figures involved in the movement such as Alex Chow Yong-kit and Nathan Law Kwun-chung. Together they formed a new organization known as Demosisto. They wanted to have real universal suffrage in Hong Kong without China interfering. On August 31st 2014, over 170,000 people marched through central Hong Kong calling for free elections. Many held umbrellas to protect themselves from sunshine while others carried banners saying things like 'I want genuine universal suffrage'. Police used tear gas and pepper spray on the crowds but did nothing else until September 28th. That day saw the start of a sit down occupation outside the Government Headquarters building. People also blocked roads"

43,"### Human: What is the name and discovery date of asteroid 90?
 ### Assistant: Asteroid 90 (also written as 90 Hera) was discovered by German astronomer Hermann Mayer Salomon Goldschmidt on September 16, 1866. It orbits in a group known as Amor asteroids that cross Earth's orbit at some point but are not considered potentially hazardous objects because they do not come close enough to cause any danger. This means it could be classified an Aten type object. It has been observed many times since its initial observation; there were only two observations before its official discovery. Its surface appears dark with few visible craters. It rotates every three hours. The asteroid takes about four years to go around the Sun once. The distance from the center of the sun can range between .3457 au and , while its perihelion is .2526 au away from the sun. There have also been several spacecraft flybys of this asteroid including Pioneers 10, 11 & Voyager 2. These encounters allowed for better mapping of the asteroid than ever done previously. On December 23, 2001 the NEAR Shoemaker space probe landed on Eros. It touched down near where the asteroid had just passed through the shadow cast over it by Jupiter during opposition. After spending more than six months exploring the asteroid, the craft crash-landed after running out of fuel. In June 2005 NASA announced plans to send another mission called Dawn into orbit around Vesta starting in July 2011. After completing its studies there, Dawn will move onto Ceres in March 2015. As part of these missions scientists hope to learn what happened to all of the water found inside the asteroids. They believe the asteroids formed when the solar system first began forming. During that time there would have been much more ice available compared to today. Water may have been lost due to melting caused by heat from impacts. Some other theories suggest the loss might have occurred later if the bodies came too close to large planets like Mars. An asteroid was named Heracles after Greek mythology’s hero who helped Zeus defeat his father Cronos. He was given a special weapon, which he used against monsters, and thus became one himself. His Roman counterpart was Hercules. Both names mean “gl"
44,"### Human: What does particle size refer to?
 ### Assistant: Particle size is the diameter of a single grain or crystal. It can also be used as an average over many particles in a given sample, where each particle has its own individual size. In some cases it may also mean the largest dimension (either length or width) that is measured by micrometry and/or microscopy.  The term ""particle"" refers either to solid particles such as sand, metallic dusts, etc., or liquid droplets or bubbles; for example, smoke is made up of tiny suspended particles called soot. Different terms are sometimes applied according to how they were formed—for instance, clay particles are often referred to as colloidal silica when they are small enough not to settle out of solution but large enough to cause problems during processing. Aerosols include both gases and liquids with suspended solids or other matter (such as water vapor). There are different types of airborne particulates depending on their size range. Some examples would be fog, mist, haze, smog, cloudlets, rainwater drops, ice crystals, snowflakes, volcanic ash, pollen grains from plants like ragweed or grasses which produce allergies among humans who breathe them into their lungs while walking outside near these fields where these kinds grow naturally without human intervention throughout most parts of North America every year since about early April until late November when winter comes back again after being away for several months before then due mostly because people don't want cold weather anymore than usual even though this happens almost always at least once per calendar month no matter what season we happen currently find ourselves living through right now today tomorrow next week sometime later soonishly whenever someone decides finally feels good enough time wise speaking ability level language fluency skill set competence expertise knowledge experience training background history bio data records documents facts figures numbers percentages rates ratios measures weights measurements amounts quantities quantity units metric system imperial standard international system kilogram meter litre cubic centimetres milliliters litres metres kilometres hectares square meters square feet acres miles kilometers kilometers kilometres yards miles yards yards feet inches metres meters centimeters millimetres nanometers picometres femtometers angstroms ångströms ångström angstrom angstroem angstroms ångstrøm ångström angstrom ang"

 ### Assistant: Claude Rich (25 February 1934 – 18 May 2017) was a French actor. He starred in more than 60 movies and television shows from the late 1950s until his death in 2017. His best known roles were as Antoine Roquentin in The Outside Man, Monsignor Riccardo Moretti in Amen., and as Paul Dédalus in La vie de bohème. In July 2014, he became an Officer of the Legion d'Honneur for his career achievements. He also won two César Awards for Best Supporting Actor in 1968 and again in 1972. He died on 18 May 2017 at age 83. He had been suffering from Alzheimer's disease since 2009. On 19 March 2018, it was announced that Rich would be posthumously awarded with a Lifetime Achievement Award by the Festival du Film Francophone en Acadie during its twentieth edition held in Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada later this year. It is scheduled to take place between September 11–16, 2018. This award will recognize Rich's contribution to francophone cinema throughout his career spanning over six decades. At the time of his passing, Rich lived in Paris. He never married or fathered any children. He has no surviving relatives. As such, all assets left behind by him are going towards charity organizations. According to his lawyer, there is about $4 million worth of cash and property. Most of these belongings consist of real estate properties which include houses located both within France and outside of Europe. These homes have not yet been sold off. There may even still be some land owned by Rich which could potentially make money through farming if bought back into production. However, because most of them already reside inside urban areas where agriculture cannot thrive anymore due to lack space available nearby nor proper infrastructure necessary like roads leading out onto fields etc... Then perhaps renting them out instead might prove profitable enough considering how high rental prices currently stand today! We can only wait till further notice though before knowing exactly what happens next regarding those untouchable pieces of land lying idle waiting patiently around somewhere else away beyond our reach"

47,"### Human: What is marzipan and how is it used in sweets and cakes?
 ### Assistant: Marzipan (also known as almond paste) is a kind of sweet. It can be made with sugar, egg whites, water or milk, butter and ground nuts like almonds or walnuts. Sometimes honey may also be added to make the mixture stick together better. Marzipan is usually white coloured. In most cases though it has been dyed green for Saint Patrick's Day or red-and-white stripes are painted on top to look like Christmas crackers. The colouring makes the difference between ""real"" and imitation marzipan. Imitation marzipan does not have any real foodstuff inside; instead it contains glucose syrup mixed with starches. This means that people who suffer from allergies to peanut products should still avoid eating them. If you do eat marzipan then wash your hands afterwards because some kinds contain traces of tree nut oils which could cause an allergy. People often use this when making fruitcakes so they don’t get stuck onto each other while baking. Some countries call these pastries by different names such as 'panforte', meaning ‘strong bread.’ They were first mentioned around 1400 AD during Medieval times where cookbooks began recording recipes using ingredients including spices, fruits, vegetables etc... Today there are many variations available worldwide ranging anywhere from traditional Italian dishes served at home or restaurants abroad through Thai dessert menus found only within Asian countries itself! One example would include Tiramisu Cake filled with mascarpone cheese & espresso coffee creams combined into layers covered overnight before serving hot chocolate sauce poured generously across its surface until set hard enough for easy slicing along edges without crumbling away upon cutting apart again later down line whenever desired once more! Another version might consist entirely outta nothing else except pure vanilla extract mixed thoroughly throughout entire contents resulting eventually finished product resembles something similar taste wise compared too those purchased commercially packaged versions sold widely today everywhere possible places imaginable under sun no matter what country happens happen live currently occupy residence right now!! So whether preferring plain simple flavours likes us here always recommend trying new things every chance gets presented sometimes ends up tasting even better than expected afterward anyway!!! ������������������"
48,"### Human: Where is Lake Saiful Muluk located?
 ### Assistant: Lake Saiful Mulook () (or Saif-ul-Mulk) is a lake in the northern part of Kaghan Valley, near Naran. It lies between the peaks of Nanga Parbat and Rakhiot at an altitude of 3,206 m above sea level. The name means ""The Fountain of Beauty"". History 
It was first discovered by British soldiers in the late nineteenth century. They named it after Prince George, Duke of York who later became King George V. The lake has been made famous because of its beauty as well as its association with Princess Shamsheer Mahal, daughter of Mian Muhammad Shah Azam Khan III. She used to come here for her summer holidays. A legend says that she met her lover Mirza Hadi Baig there. He drowned himself when he learnt about their parents' plans to marry them off against his will. This story inspired many Urdu poets including Allama Iqbal, Faiz Ahmed Faiz, Ali Sardar Jafri etc. The area around the lake is now known as Saif ul Malook or Saif u l Molok. There are several hotels nearby where people can stay while visiting this beautiful place.
There is also a small village called Kalabagh which offers accommodation facilities too! However most visitors prefer camping outdoors during summers months due to extreme weather conditions especially cold winds from snowcapped mountains surrounding this region making life difficult without proper shelter/shelter system available locally; thus leading us back towards our ancestral roots again... This ancient practice still exists today but unfortunately only few know how important it really is.. To survive harsh winter season one must build own home rather than relying upon others'. As per local folklore there were once two brothers living together on opposite sides of river Indus valley before partition took place; however they never saw each other ever since then except through letters exchanged every year during Christmas time.. Nowadays both families live far away from each other across border line dividing Indian subcontinent into Pakistan & India respectively - so much so even though we share same culture yet distance separates us forever!!!

50,"### Human: What is the House of slaves and where is it located?
 ### Assistant: The House of slaves (, ) is a former slave house in Dubrovnik. It was built around 1490 by the Rector Marin Bokanić as part of his palace. Today there are only ruins left but they can be seen from outside. They show how people lived during that time period. There used to be a garden with orange trees behind the building. In front of the house is a small fountain made for watering the plants. The fountain has an octagonal shape. On top of the fountain is a statue of a lion which belonged to the family that owned the house after Bokanic died. The house had two floors. Slaves were kept on the first floor while their masters stayed upstairs. Above them was a terrace. This is now gone. The roof was also removed at some point because no one knew what to do with it. In 2005 the government decided to restore parts of the house so tourists could see it better. However this project never finished because not enough money was available. Some locals want to rebuild all or most of the original structure instead. Others think restoring would make more sense since much less damage would have been done if the old building hadn't been destroyed already. Tourism isn’t very popular here right now anyway due to COVID-19 pandemic restrictions making travel difficult worldwide. So far only about half a million visitors per year come through town compared to over six million before lockdown measures started being taken back in March 2020 when schools closed down across Croatia along with many businesses like restaurants bars hotels etcetera too! That means almost everything else besides hospitality services remained open until recently though still requiring mask wearing upon entry into buildings public transportation bus stations trains airports harbours ports etc…...and social distancing guidelines remain enforced even inside shops grocery stores pharmacies banks post offices libraries museum galleries cultural centres churches mosques synagogues temples etcetera..as well!. As you might expect then everyone seems pretty happy living life under these conditions despite occasional protests against mandatory vaccination programs taking place throughout Europe currently especially Greece Spain Portugal Italy France Germany Belgium Netherlands Luxembourg Denmark Sweden Norway Finland Iceland Ireland Scotland Wales Northern Ireland United Kingdom Republic Of Ireland South Africa Australia New Zealand Canada USA Mexico Brazil Argentina Chile"

53,"### Human: Who was the first Australian born explorer?
 ### Assistant: John McDouall Stuart (1815 – 23 September 1864) was an Scottish-Australian explorer. He became known as the ""Father of Australian Exploration"". His birthplace is thought to be near St Andrews, Fife in Scotland but he spent most of his life living and working on a farm at Tarcowie in South Australia with his wife Elizabeth and their four children. In 1850 Stuart went north from Adelaide through Central Australia, crossing the continent for the first time by land. This journey took him seven months. The following year he led an expedition which crossed the continent again, this time travelling eastwards across the centre before heading south back into Western Australia. During these expeditions he discovered many important waterholes including Cooper Creek where he found an oasis that saved the lives of those who were ill or injured during the trip. At the end of both trips Stuart reached the coast in what is now the Northern Territory. On each occasion he travelled overland until reaching the Gulf of Carpentaria when he turned westward along its shores looking for an opening into the Indian Ocean. Neither attempt succeeded due to strong winds and currents making it impossible to find a way out. After returning to England he tried unsuccessfully to raise money so he could return and complete the task. While there he met Sir Richard Burton who asked if he would like to lead another group of men to explore central Africa. Although he accepted the offer, he soon left after finding himself frustrated with the lack of freedom given to members of the party. As a result, he returned home early and later died of consumption. Today Stuart's name is commemorated in several places throughout the country including a mountain range, township, road, park, river, lake, creek, pass and mine. A statue of him stands outside Parliament House, Canberra. There are also statues of him in Darwin and Alice Springs. A portrait of him hangs inside Government House in Perth. Many streets around the city have been named after him. Several schools bear his surname while one of them has a cricket field called 'Stuart Oval'. Two other public buildings carry his namesake. They include a library at Flinders University in Victoria and the National Library in Canberra. It should not be confused with John Macdougal Stuart whose middle name had two d'"

55,"### Human: What is the history and origin of Denial Bay?
 ### Assistant: Denial Bay (also known as Kangaroo Island) is a bay on Kangaroo Island, South Australia. It was named by Matthew Flinders in 1802 after he saw kangaroos hopping along its shores. The bay has been used for many years to ship supplies from mainland Australia into Adelaide. In recent times it has become an important tourist destination with visitors able to see local wildlife such as sea lions. History
The first European land exploration at this location took place around 1796 when Nicolas Baudin sailed past the island. He had no idea that there were people living here until he met some Aboriginals while sailing near Cape Willoughby. This happened because they left their camp fires burning which attracted him towards them. He spent time talking about what life would be like if everyone lived together instead of fighting over resources all day long; however none agreed so nothing came out of meeting these two groups who both spoke different languages. Two months later he returned back home but forgot how far north or south they traveled during those weeks away from civilization where nobody could understand anything else except English language spoken only once before! On November 3rd 1802 British explorer Captain Matthew Flinders anchored his vessel Investigator offshore from Port Lincoln harbor entrance onto East coast side of Tankerville Peninsula which includes part called Penneshaw township today located across waterway channel leading inside port itself named Backstairs Passage between mainland continent & KI Island's east end point called Cape du Couedic (named after French navigators Antoine Bruni d’Entrecasteaux).

56,"### Human: What are cannabinoids and how do they work?
 ### Assistant: Cannabinoid is a chemical compound found in the plant genus Cannabis. It has many effects on humans when taken as medicine or recreationally (in small amounts). The most common ones are tetrahydrocannabinol, also known as THC; and cannabidiol, which does not have mind-altering properties like marijuana's main ingredient. CBD oil contains no psychoactive substances such as THC but still offers some benefits to users because it acts similarly to an endocannabinoid system modulator by interacting with receptors within cells that regulate mood/appetite etc., thus helping reduce anxiety without causing intoxicating side effects associated with smoking pot! This makes sense since these two molecules act differently at different concentrations--they both bind tightly enough for medical purposes while only binding weakly enough so you don’t get high off them alone either way if used correctly (which means taking low doses over time instead of just one big hit all at once). 
When consumed together though there may be synergistic effects due their similarities despite being completely separate from each other chemically speaking - meaning more than additive effect could occur between the two agents depending upon what type of product was consumed simultaneously versus separately during testing trials done here at home base labs located throughout America... 
Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is one of several active components found naturally occurring inside hemp plants along side CBCA acid derivatives including CBDA & CBGAC which produce distinctive therapeutic profiles compared against traditional medicines derived solely using synthetic methods based primarily around D9 Tetrahydroxycannabinol . These differences allow us access unique ways where we might better treat various health conditions through targeted application rather then simply throwing out entire classes drugs often times leaving patients worse then before treatment started trying something new every single day until eventually finding success somewhere down line after years spent searching blindly hoping something would happen soon enough somehow magical miracle cure came suddenly appear right before our eyes ready save everyone involved involved situation desperate need help solve problem forevermore now please take care yourself enjoy rest peaceful sleep good night dream sweet dreams happy dreams lovely lady luck bless your heart always remember keep calm carry on smile wide open arms embrace joy happiness love light kindness gentlen"

58,"### Human: What is Burgundy?
 ### Assistant: Burgundy (; , ; ) is a historical region of France. It was the name given to the eastern half of ancient Gaul, which occupied much of what today are the administrative regions of Bourgogne and Franche-Comté in east-central France. In 52 BC it became part of Gallia Cisalpina after Julius Caesar conquered Gaul. By the end of the Merovingian era in AD 751, all lands between the Seine River on the west and Rhine River on the north were ruled by kings called ""Dukes"" or ""Counts"". They used the title Comte de Bourgogne (""count of Burgundy""). The area came under Frankish rule during the reign of Clovis I around 486–509 AD. After Charlemagne divided his empire into West Francia and East Francia in 843 AD, many small states developed including Burgundy proper. These included Arles, Provence, Toulouse, Roussillon, Aquitaine, Auvergne and others. Each had its own counts who owed allegiance to their king. During this time, Burgundians spoke Alemannic German dialects such as Alamannic, Swabian and Alemannians, but also Old High German language. From about 1000 AD, Burgundies began speaking French. This happened because they intermarried with the local people from the Loire Valley. Soon most Burgundes no longer could speak their ancestral languages. But some did preserve these traditions for centuries. They lived mostly in the south where there were few other people living at that time. As late as the 14th century, Chambord Castle still employed an official named ""Germanus"" whose job was to oversee the castle's German workers. There were many castles built here and the nobility owned large estates along the Saône river valley. Many towns like Chalon sur Saone, Dijon, Beaune, Mâcon, Cluny and Tournus flourished due to trade with Flanders across the border. Some families like the Salm-Salm family became quite wealthy through their extensive land holdings. Others took advantage of the rich farmlands along the rivers. Most Burgundians however remained poor peasants working small plots of land while doing seasonal work elsewhere. When King Louis VII died"

The last update for the device was released on March 3rd, 2015. This phone can still run some apps but most are not compatible anymore.

 ### Assistant: Albania was first at the Olympic Games in 1952. They have been in every Summer Olympic Games since then, except for boycotting the 1980 Moscow Olympics and missing the 1964 Tokyo Olympics because they did not qualify any athletes to compete that year. The National Olympic Committee for Albania was formed in 1937. It was recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1952. Albanian athletes have won a total of six medals at the games. All were bronze medals from weightlifting events. History
Albanians competed as part of Yugoslav teams until 1952 when an independent team went to Helsinki. In 1992, they returned to the summer games after a 40-year absence due to political instability following World War II. They sent their largest contingent ever to Sydney with 30 competitors. At the time this made them one of only three nations whose delegations had grown larger than before the war. The other two countries were Bosnia & Herzegovina and Serbia & Montenegro. Since then, they have missed five straight winter olympics between 2002–2010. This includes four consecutive summers starting in 2004. Their best performance came at Athens in 2004 where they finished fifth overall on medal table outperforming many stronger European powers like France or Spain. That same year they also beat Australia who has traditionally done well at these kinds of events such as sailing races etc..
Their most successful Olympian thus far remains Erion Veliaj with his gold medal win back during Beijing's 2008 edition which helped him become famous throughout Europe including Britain thanks largely towards his strong showing there despite being relatively unknown prior up till then point especially considering how poorly he performed elsewhere around world earlier times beforehand too... Aside from Veliaj however another notable athlete would be Skander Halili whom represented Albania twice over course years finishing fourth once behind Greece but ahead Croatia both occasions respectively though sadly neither ended up winning anything either way even though they tried hard enough each respective occasion nonetheless regardless still making sure everyone knew about themselves no matter what happened next anyway! Despite having some success recently however things haven’t always gone smoothly here either unfortunately; For instance while participating last"

On September 3rd 2018, it burnt down because there were no firefighters on duty during that night due to budget cutbacks by Jair Bolsonaro's government. There are rumours about arsonists being behind this incident but they have not been proven yet. The most valuable artefact lost was an Egyptian mummy named ""Cleopatra"".

 ### Assistant: Petra Maria Mede (born 17 March 1970) is a Swedish actress, comedian and television presenter. She was born in Stockholm County. In the mid-2000s she became known for her role as Sanna Marander in TV series Uppdrag granskning. Since then, she has been working with several comedy programmes on Sveriges Television such as Allsång på Skansen, Stand up i Parken and På spåret. From December 2014 to January 2015, she presented Melodifestivalen together with Anders Antonson. They were both hosts of the Eurovision Song Contest 2016 held in Sweden's capital city, Stockholm. On May 3, 2018 it was announced that Mede will be one of four new presenters at the 2018 Nobel Prize Award Ceremony along with Joakim Nätterquist, Lena Philipsson and Ola Salo. The ceremony took place on Monday 10th December 2018. It was broadcast live by SVT. Mede also hosted this year's Eurovision Song Contest which was won by Duncan Laurence from Netherlands with his song ""Arcade"". This made him the first male solo artist ever since Conchita Wurst back in 2014 to win the contest. He beat out runner ups Russia and Italy who came second and third respectively. Both countries are usually very strong contenders but failed to deliver their best songs. This meant that the host country Sweden finished fourth behind Switzerland who achieved its highest placing yet finishing in third place. Ireland performed poorly after being tipped off to finish top three or even winning it altogether. However they only managed to come sixth despite performing well in rehearsals beforehand. This means Ireland now have never won the competition despite having competed every time except once when they had an automatic qualifier because they were hosting so long ago under their previous name Eire/Éire meaning Ireland Gaelic language form used until recently instead of Irish English version we use today which replaced Latin based words like Éireann etc.. With regards to other countries there wasn't much else going on apart from Poland getting eliminated early again after failing twice last year due mostly down too bad luck although some would argue otherwise given how hard these guys tried over those two occasions whilst competing against stronger nations than them"

74,"### Human: Who is the god of water and the sea in ancient Roman religion and mythology?
 ### Assistant: Neptune (Latin; Ancient Greek: Ποταμός, Potamos) was a major deity in ancient Roman religion and myth. He was the god of freshwater springs, rivers, seas, and bodies of salt water. He was also a god of trade because he protected sailors at sea. In addition to these roles, Neptune was considered by the Romans as an enemy of the hero Heracles due to his role in the death of Hercules' friend Iolaus. His sacred animal was the dolphin, which is sometimes used today on naval insignia. The name comes from Etruscan Volturnus via Latin potens ""the strong one"" or perhaps from Poseidon, the equivalent Greek god. Although most scholars think that there were originally two gods called Nethuns and Salacia who became combined into one god named Neptunus during the later stages of Rome's history. This would explain why some depictions show him with only half body while others have full body. However, there are other theories such as those proposed by Mircea Eliade and Marcel Detienne which state otherwise but they do not seem convincing enough for mainstream scholarship. Some historians believe this merger occurred around 249 BC when the Carthaginians defeated the Romans at the Battle of Drepana which led them being conquered by Rome shortly afterward whereupon their pantheons merged together forming what we now know as modern day Roman Mythology. But regardless whether it happened then or beforehand there seems little doubt among experts regarding its occurrence sometime within Rome's early period if not much earlier than even then itself since all evidence points towards this conclusion rather conclusively speaking frankly here right now... So yeah.. That's pretty much how things went down back in those days folks!

 ### Assistant: Ronald Ervin ""Ron"" McNair (October 21, 1950 – January 28, 2003) was an American astronaut and physicist. He flew aboard the Space Shuttle Challenger on mission STS-41B in February–March 1984 as a Mission Specialist. On that flight he performed three spacewalks. In addition to his work with NASA, he also worked at Hughes Aircraft Company where he designed parts for satellites. After leaving NASA, he taught physics at MIT from 1986 until his death. He was born in Lake City, South Carolina. His mother's family were African Americans while his father's family were white. They moved around often when he was young because of racism against them. During one move they lived near Denver, Colorado. There he got interested in science. At first he wanted to be a doctor but then decided to become a scientist instead after reading about Albert Einstein. As a student he became friends with Sally Ride who would later join him at NASA. She said she learned more about being black by talking to him than any other person. For college he went to North Carolina State University. Then he earned two master degrees; one in Physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and another in Astronomy from Johns Hopkins University. While earning those degrees he wrote papers about astronomical objects such as stars and galaxies. He received his PhD degree from Princeton University in 1976. This thesis was titled An Analytic Model Of The Structure And Dynamics Of Magnetized Neutron Stars. It had ideas about how neutrons could form inside pulsars. Pulsar is what scientists call very fast spinning stars which emit light waves like lighthouses do. These are sometimes called radio telescopes. Other people have used these ideas since then. Some say it has been important for understanding supernovas. Another thing he did during this time was write some books. One book was written with John D. Roberts called High Energy Astrophysics. He also co-authored Black Holes: Fact or Fiction?. Both of these were published by Wiley & Sons Inc. While working there he also helped create new equipment including detectors for X-rays and gamma rays. In 19"
77,"### Human: What is taurine and where does it come from?
 ### Assistant: Taurine (also called 2-aminoethanesulfonic acid) is an amino sulfonic acid. It was first discovered in the year 1827 by Friedrich Wöhler, but he thought that it came from bile juice of a cow or ox. In fact, the body makes it itself out of other substances. The human body needs only small amounts to work properly; most people can make enough for themselves. Some supplements have added taurine because they think it helps athletes' performance. However there are not many studies on this topic yet so we do not know if this really works. If you take too much, your heart may beat faster than normal which could be dangerous. Doctors say that people who drink energy drinks with lots of caffeine should avoid taking extra doses of taurine. This is because some evidence shows that excessive use of these products over time might increase the risk of developing arrhythmia. People usually get more taurine from eating meat such as chicken breast, steak, fish fillets etc., then from dairy foods like cheese, milk, yogurt and ice creams. Certain kinds of seafood also contain high levels of taurine including anchovies, salmon, trout and mackerel. For vegetarians, taurine can be found naturally in avocados. A few plant sources include wheat germ, sesame seeds and pistachios. Pregnant women need about half what nonpregnant adults require each day. Infants up through age one month will need even less. Breastfeeding mothers produce taurine while making milk for their baby. These recommendations were made based upon research done at Cornell University during World War II when rationing took place due to shortages caused by war efforts around Europe and Asia Pacific regions. As part of those experiments conducted between 1940–45, scientists studied how children developed under different nutritional conditions provided either adequate dietary intake versus insufficient/inadequate supply compared against controls fed regular meals containing sufficient daily allowance according guidelines established earlier before wartime restrictions went into effect across multiple nations affected worldwide. Research revealed significant deficiencies occurred among infants whose parents did not receive proper guidance regarding appropriate quantities needed per person’s weight classifications determined"

 ### Assistant: Halabja (, ) is an Iraqi Kurdish town in the northern part of the country. It has about 40 thousand people living there. On March 16th and 17th, 1988, Saddam Hussein's army attacked it with chemical weapons. The attack killed over five thousand people including children. Many more were injured or had health problems from the attacks. This event became known as the Halabja Massacre. After the war, many people left for other countries like Germany and Sweden because they did not want to live under Saddam Hussein anymore. In recent years, some have come back due to better security conditions in the area. Today, Halabja is one of the most important cities in the province of Sulaymaniyah.

80,"### Human: What is the appearance of the Japanese dwarf flying squirrel?
 ### Assistant: The Japanese dwarf flying squirrel (Pteromys momonga) or Momo-guma, is a species in the family Sciuridae. It lives only on Honshu Island and Kyushu Islands in Japan. Appearance 
The body length of this animal ranges from to . Its tail measures about half its total body size. They have short legs and small eyes compared with other flying squirrels. Their fur color varies by region but it usually has white belly hair. In some places they are blackish brown above and pale below while others are darker colored all over. Some animals can be grayish red near their head. There is also one subspecies that looks like an ordinary grey squirrel. This variety lives in southern parts of Kagoshima Prefecture and Miyazaki Prefecture. These two types live separately and do not interbreed so there may soon become different species again. Different names for these creatures include momo goma, mamogo, mo-goo, shirokoba, hikobata, and kawabata. Diet 
Japanese dwarf flying squirrels eat seeds, nuts, fruits, fungi, insect larvae, snails, lizards, eggs, bird chicks, and carrion. Like most flying squirrels, they use their strong front teeth to chew through bark to get at tree sap. They often feed during winter when food sources are scarce because they hibernate then too. Life cycle 
Breeding takes place between April and July depending upon where you live in Japan's southwestern islands including Shimojishima which lies off Okinawa prefecture’s coastline close enough that people sometimes call them ""Okinawan flying squirrels."" Females give birth after four months gestation period followed immediately by another five weeks before weaning occurs around sixteen days later than usual among similar rodents worldwide except those found exclusively within Africa where such behavior happens much sooner due mainly because females tend toward shorter periods before giving birth than males who typically wait longer until conditions allow more time for reproductive success thus increasing overall population numbers even further still since fewer youngsters die premature deaths if given extra care right away instead waiting till older age groups reach full potential growth rate levels first before making decisions based solely upon survival rates alone no"

 ### Assistant: Captain Arthur J. ""Jack"" Jackson (June 15, 1924 – April 6, 2020) was an American soldier in World War II who received the United States' highest military honor—the Medal of Honor. He is one of only two enlisted men to have won it twice; the other being Army Sergeant Alvin Cullom York. He served as a corporal with Company K, 3rd Battalion, 7th Cavalry Regiment when they were attacked by overwhelming forces at Bilibid Prison on February 8–9, 1945. For his actions that day, he would be awarded both Medals of Honor. He later went back into combat during the Battle of Okinawa where he was wounded again while helping others. After the war ended, he returned home from Japan aboard USS General W. M. Black. On May 26, 1945, President Harry S. Truman presented him with his first medal along with three other soldiers at The White House. In August 1945, he left active duty and joined the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve. In October 1946, he re-enlisted in the U.S. Navy. During his time in service, he rose up through the ranks becoming a chief petty officer before retiring in November 1965 after serving nearly twenty years total between all branches of the Armed Forces. While living in Florida, he worked at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station until his death. On March 18, 2015, Vice Admiral Joseph D. Kernan visited Jackson at his home in Port St. Lucie, Florida. They talked about their shared experiences fighting against the Japanese Empire during World War II. He died there on April 6, 2020 at age 95. His funeral was held at Fort Pierce National Cemetery on June 16, 2020. At the ceremony, Jackson's daughter said her father had never wanted any recognition for himself but instead just wanted people to know how much he loved them. She also read letters sent out from former Marines thanking him for saving their lives. One letter came from a man named Edwin Vargas who wrote “I want you to know I owe my life because of your bravery.” Another letter was"
83,"### Human: Who is Edward Snowden and what did he do?
 ### Assistant: Edwin ""Edward"" Joseph (born June 21, 1983) known as Edward Snowden, is an American computer specialist. He worked for the United States National Security Agency (NSA). In early June 2013, he leaked information about NSA surveillance to several media organizations including The Guardian and Der Spiegel. This caused a worldwide debate over privacy concerns in the digital age. On August 5, 2014, Snowden was granted temporary political asylum by Russia until July 31, 2020. As of September 2016, Snowden has been living in Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport since leaving Hong Kong on June 23, 2013. His current status remains unknown. After spending one year in exile at this airport, it is not clear where he will go next or when. Snowden also said that he would like to return home. However, because of his legal situation there are no plans to extradite him back to America yet. According to a statement from President Obama, Snowden may be charged with violations of U.S. espionage law. It could mean up to thirty years imprisonment if found guilty. But, according to many experts who have followed these kinds of cases closely before; such charges might never actually happen due mainly because they believe doing so would cause more problems than solutions between our two countries right now given recent events involving cyberattacks against us both here recently which were believed done by foreign sources too! So far neither side seems willing enough even though some say things must change somehow eventually but nobody knows exactly how much longer we can wait either way unfortunately…..so time will tell whether anything changes soon hopefully though maybe someday soon???!!!!! Hopefully???:)))))

 ### Assistant: George Mraz (June 21, 1935 – February 6, 2021) was a Czech-American jazz bassist. He worked with musicians such as Benny Goodman and Stan Getz. His career began in the late 1940s. In January 2021 it was announced that he had tested positive for COVID-19 while living at an assisted care facility near Chicago, Illinois on December 8 of that year. On February 6, 2021, his death from complications caused by COVID-19 was confirmed to have occurred six days earlier. He was aged 85. Mraz died on February 6, 2021 in Evanston, Illinois at age 85. A funeral service will be held at St. Nicholas Church in New York City on March 7. The family is planning a memorial concert later this spring or summer which they hope can take place outside where people are allowed to gather safely due to coronavirus restrictions. They also plan a tribute event when traveling again becomes safer after the pandemic has passed. Mraz' son Michael said ""We just want him remembered."" In addition to his wife Jeanne and sons Michael and Paul, Mraz is survived by four grandchildren. He was preceded in death by daughter Linda Marie Mraz. Another daughter, Melissa Ann Mraz, committed suicide in 2016 following her father’s diagnosis of dementia. She left behind two young children who were not hers biologically but she raised them since their mother was unable to do so. According to Mraz' brother Milan, both daughters were estranged from their parents before they died because they did not approve of how Mraz handled his finances during retirement. During his final years, Mraz lived off his savings alone without any help until his death. He refused financial assistance from friends and relatives because he felt like being poor made him stronger. After getting sick, Mraz lost all interest in playing music despite previously having performed publicly up through last fall including appearances with pianists Gene Harris and Monty Alexander along with other artists. When asked about why he stopped performing, Mraz responded “I don’t know what happened.” Despite suffering from severe memory loss towards the end of life, Mraz could still play simple songs if someone else taught them to him firsthand"
86,"### Human: Who was Galileo Galilei and what is he most remembered for?
 ### Assistant: Galileo Galilei (15 February 1564 – 8 January 1642) was an Italian astronomer, physicist, philosopher, mathematician. He made many discoveries in science with the telescope which changed people's ideas about how things worked. He also had to spend time in jail because of his ideas on religion that were different from those held by the Catholic Church at that time. The planet Jupiter has four large moons named after him and three others as well. These are called the Galilean Moons or Galilean Satellites. His name means ""Galilee"" + ""-io"". This refers to where he lived when he grew up. It may be spelled Galilee in English too. In Italy it would have been spelt Gali-lee-jo but this form does not make sense so it became Ga-li-leo instead. When translating names into other languages they often change them slightly so we now use 'Galileo'. The asteroid numbered 3907 is named after him. It is written Galileo. There is a crater on Mars named after him. A moon of Uranus is named Galatea. And there is even a comet named after him. Comets are usually given two-part names like Halley's Comet, but Galileo's comet only needs one part - Galileo. Sometimes when someone gets a star named after them you can see its name using your binoculars if you know exactly where to look. For example, you might find stars whose names start with 'V' because these are visible through binoculars. You should get outdoors under dark skies, away from light pollution, and try looking around near the southwest horizon during late summer/early autumn. If you do then you will probably notice some bright stars just above the southern horizon. Look very closely at Vega and Castor and Pollux, the twins who used to race Hercules across the sky every night long ago. Nowadays they stay put while their friend circles round the pole star overnight. Try finding the little dimmer dot between them; it looks more yellow than white. That’s the northern hemisphere's own Pole Star! On clear winter nights it stands almost directly overhead, although it moves slowly westward each day"

 ### Assistant: Dalby Forest (formerly called Norton Forest) is a forest in the North York Moors National Park, England. It was formerly owned by the Ministry of Defence but has been run as an independent charity since 2015. The forest covers . In summer it gets about visitors each day and there are overnight camping sites available at the north end. There is also a visitor centre with exhibitions on local wildlife including red squirrels, dormice and bats. A trail through the forest leads to Holey Cross where St Cuthbert's coffin rested during its journey from Lindisfarne to Durham. The area around Holey Cross includes some prehistoric earthworks which were excavated in the late nineteenth century. They included evidence that a wooden fort had once stood here. These have now become covered again by woodland vegetation. An Iron Age settlement, possibly belonging to the Brigantes tribe who lived nearby, may be located within the forest boundary near Wold Top. This is thought to have existed between 47 BC and AD 383 when it was abandoned after Roman invasion. In 1968, the Forestry Commission started planting trees along what they believed would be the route of the railway line from Pickering to Whitby. However, this never happened because of difficulties raising funds for construction. As a result, these areas contain mainly coniferous species such as Scots pine rather than native broadleaf trees like oak or ash found elsewhere in the forest. Today most people come to walk their dogs off-leash, cycle or horse ride through one of Britain’s biggest remaining expanses of natural woodland. Some parts remain untouched by human activity apart from occasional controlled burnings carried out under licences issued by Natural England. The main access point into Dalby Forest lies just south west of Helmsley village. Other entrances can be found further away towards Kirkbymoorside/Goathland via High Mill Road; Thirsk / Sutton Bank via Brompton Lodge Lane (off A1); and Malton / Rievaulx Abbey via Newgate Lane. On average, the temperature varies throughout all seasons ranging from -1°C in winter up to +23°C during hot summers months! Precipitation levels range from light rain showers lasting only minutes every few days right"

 ### Assistant: A sachet d'épices (sack of spice) or pot-pourri in English, is a small bag containing ground herbs. It was first made to be hung from the neck like an amulet. The contents were thought to protect against disease, evil spirits, witchcraft, bad luck, etc. They are still often given as gifts at Christmas time for good health during the coming year. Sachets can also be found with other purposes such as perfume and medicine. In France they have been sold since 1907 by the company Roure Frères & Cie. It has been called ""the best known French brand"". The name comes from the Latin sacci meaning 'bag'. These bags are usually kept in drawers, cupboards and closets because their scent will last much longer than if you keep them out on display where the air circulates more freely. You could also put some under your pillow when sleeping so that it helps you relax before going to bed. Sachet powder contains essential oils which help people feel better about themselves. This means less stress overall and more energy throughout each day! There are many different kinds available today including lavender oil, rose petals, jasmine flower extract, patchouli leaf resin, sandalwood paste, rosemary leaves extract, cedar wood chips, orange peel essence, cinnamon sticks extract, vanilla pod pieces...etcetera . Some companies even make special blends just for pets too - perfect solution if Fido gets sick while traveling abroad.

92,"### Human: What is a bistro and what kind of food do they serve?
 ### Assistant: A bistro (pronounced BEE-stro) is a type of restaurant. It serves simple, inexpensive French dishes like steak frites or boeuf à la mode. In English the word ""bistros"" can also mean small cafés that sell sandwiches, salads, coffee drinks, pastries, etc., but not necessarily with table service. This article is about restaurants which are called bistrôs in Brazilian Portuguese. History 
The first modern bistro opened around 1830 on Rue de Richelieu in Paris. The owner was Boulanger Patissier Alexis Benoît Lemaire who named it Le Grand Vefour after his grandmother's name. He had worked at another famous restaurant in Paris, La Maison Dorée. When he went to work there, he found out that many people liked eating good food without spending too much money for expensive meals. So he decided to open a place where customers could eat well while paying less than if they were going into a more formal restaurant. The idea caught on quickly because soon other restaurateurs copied him by opening their own places offering simpler menus at lower prices. These became known as 'bistros'. Today you will find them all over France and beyond; even some outside Europe now call themselves bistros! There isn’t really any official definition though – just something that looks right when someone says ‘bistro’...or maybe just sounds nice enough so that we want our own little bit of culture & history added onto everything else already existing here today :) 
Because most bistros offer lighter fare such as salad plates instead of full courses along with wine list options ranging from $25-$40 per bottle - this makes them ideal choices for those looking for an affordable alternative compared to fine dining establishments located nearby . They often feature live music performances during peak hours making them popular hangout spots among locals seeking entertainment value alongside great tasting cuisine served up fast & fresh every day until late night closing times! Some patrons may order takeaway items before heading home afterwards depending upon how busy things get inside each particular establishment throughout its operating schedule periodically adjusted accordingly based off current demand levels experienced within respective communities surrounding said venues at given points throughout calendar year timetables determined solely through individual business decisions made prior arrangement commenc"

His first championship medal came after he replaced regular keeper Mickey McCloskey against Cavan during the final of the 1967 Championship. The following year saw him make his full debut against Galway when McCloskey broke his leg on the opening day of the season; they lost by five points but Patterson kept them in contention until the last few minutes of the game. In September 1968, Patterson was part of the Derry squad which beat Meath at Croke Park to win their second Sam Maguire Cup title since independence. This victory meant there were now only two counties who had not been champions since partition, Kerry and Tyrone. During this period he also made one appearance for Ireland's national football team. At club level, he helped his native parish side, St Mary's Swatragh/Glenswilly claim several Donegal SFL Division One championships before retiring due to injury problems in the late 1970s.

95,"### Human: What happens to the body during starvation?
 ### Assistant: Starvation is when a person or animal does not have enough food. The human body can survive for about 25 days without eating, but this depends on how much fat and water it has stored in its cells beforehand. When there are no nutrients left in the bloodstream (the liquid that carries oxygen around), then all of the organs will start shutting down one by one until death occurs from lack of energy production due to low glucose levels in muscle tissue which causes them to stop working properly as well! This process takes place over time because our bodies need food every day just like any other living thing out here doing whatever they do best at life's expense; however we humans don’t eat constantly throughout each twenty-four hour period so if someone goes too long between meals then their metabolism slows wayyyy down resulting in less waste being produced per minute than usual causing stomach cramps etc...which leads us back into talking about what actually happens inside your body while you fast/starve yourself!!! The first thing I want everyone reading these words right now know though is this: ""If anyone ever tells u otherwise regarding anything related with dieting please remember those two simple facts & forget everything else cuz only truth matters."" If someone says something different then run away quickly lol jkjkj Just kidding ;) Now let's get started shall we?????!!!!
When people go hungry, their brains make chemical changes that lead to depression and anxiety. These feelings may be triggered even after eating again because some parts of the brain stay “on” longer than others—even when hunger isn’t an issue anymore.” In fact, researchers believe that hunger itself could cause depressive symptoms such as hopelessness and suicidal thoughts through changes made within certain areas of our gray matter. However, more studies still need conducting since many questions remain unanswered about exactly why this might happen…and whether there would also exist ways for prevention against negative effects caused solely due to malnourishment alone vs both issues together combined into one problematic situation where neither condition alone provides relief either emotionally nor physically speaking yet somehow both seem connected regardless despite appearances suggesting opposite results initially based off current evidence available thus far anyway.. So yes folks, although sometimes hardships arise unexpectedly along various paths taken daily lives overall continue moving forward always making progress toward eventual destination"

97,"### Human: What is the chemical formula and properties of bismuthine?
 ### Assistant: Bismuthine, also known as dibismuth(III) oxide or bisminium trioxide (Bi2O3), is a chemical compound. It contains bismuth in its +3 oxidation state. Properties 
It is an orange-red solid. Its melting point is about . The boiling temperature is about . Chemistry 
Bismuthine reacts with water to make hydrogen gas, Bi2O3+6H2O → 2BiOH3+3H2↑; it can be made by heating bismuth metal in air at high temperatures. If the reaction goes too fast, then all that will happen is that the oxygen from the atmosphere will combine with some of the bismuth atoms to form Bi2O3. This makes sense because if you heat up something like iron for long enough, it turns into rust - iron oxide. However, this does not mean that iron oxide has always been there during the whole process. Sometimes metals such as gold can burn completely without any sign of the element they were made out of. In these cases, no other elements are involved in the reactions except those given above. That's why we call them ""burning"". So what happens when one tries to produce pure bismuthine? Well, let us assume that someone wants to do so but doesn't know how exactly it works yet. He would start off making some bismuth chlorides first using electrolysis on dilute solutions containing bihalogen acids (e.g., HCl). Then he would take away the halogens again by adding concentrated sulfuric acid until only free Bi2O3 remained behind after evaporation under vacuum conditions. Finally, this last product could easily be purified further through recrystallization over phosphoric acid crystal paper sheets. But wait! There might still exist impurities left inside which cause problems later downstream due their different solubilities compared against each other within certain pH ranges... Let me explain what I just said here below: First things first: We need to understand that most common types of salts dissolve best at low pH levels whereas others prefer higher ones instead depending upon whether our goal was either removing carbon dioxide from CO2 or getting rid off sodium chloride from NaCl respectively.. For example, calcium nitrate readily dissociates"

In September 2017, it was announced that Holt had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease at age ninety-one years old. On October 13, 2020, it was reported that Holt died on December 30, aged one hundred four. Her death came three months after the death of another former Mayor of Seattle, Norm Rice. They both outlived their wives, who predeceased them by several decades; both women also lived into their nineties. A longtime resident of Ballard, Washington, Holt married Richard W. Holt Jr., who preceded her in death in July 2020. The couple did not have any children together but raised two stepchildren following his remarriage. Holt is survived by these stepchildren and nieces and nephews. With her husband being born in Japan, they traveled there during the Cold War when he was stationed overseas while serving in the U.S. Navy. This experience made Holt fluent in Japanese. After leaving office, Holt went back to college studying history and political science before earning a master’s degree in public administration. For many years afterwards, she taught courses about governmental policy issues at University of Washington. In April 2014, President Barack Obama appointed Holt to serve on the White House Commission on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. That same year, Governor Jay Inslee named her chairwoman of the state commission tasked with creating a memorial honoring the victims of the internment camps where people of Japanese ancestry were held during World War II. In March 2016, Holt became part of a group working towards the creation of a national monument commemorating those interred in such facilities. Later that month, she joined other members of the Japanese American community in protesting against Trump supporters outside of the Republican presidential nominee's rally in Portland, Oregon.
