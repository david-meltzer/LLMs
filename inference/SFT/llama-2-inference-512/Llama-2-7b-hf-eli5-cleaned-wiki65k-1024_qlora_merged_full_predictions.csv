 ### Assistant: The leopard cat (Prionailurus bengalensis) is a small wildcat. It lives in south and southeast Asia, from India to China and Indonesia. This animal has many names such as binturong or flat-headed cat. It was first described by Carl Linnaeus in 1758 under its current name. Leopard cats are found throughout much of Southeastern Asia, including Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, East Timor, Philippines, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, Hong Kong, North Korea, Mongolia, Russia's Far Eastern Amur Region and Sakhalin Island. In southern China it occurs on Hainan island. They live mainly in forests but can also be seen living near rice fields, farms and human settlements. Its fur color varies depending upon location; dark brownish-gray with black markings along back and sides in northern regions changing to grayish tan or yellowish white with lighter spots elsewhere. Leopard Cats have been introduced into Hawaiian Islands where they now exist as an invasive species that compete with native birds & mammals for food sources while preying upon them too! These animals hunt at night using their excellent eyesight which allows them to detect movement even when it’s pitch black outside thanks to specialized retinal cells known as rod photoreceptors. Their diet consists mostly insects like grasshoppers crickets etc., though larger ones may take down smaller mammals if given opportunity - sometimes these include domestic poultry eggs/chicks even ducks geese swans gulls terns waders shorebirds waterfowls woodcock snipe rails galliformes quails doves pigeons parrots cockatoos penguins albatrosses pelicans storks herons egrets bitterns ibises spoonbills flamingoes sandpipers auks skuas jaegers guillemots razorbill puffins loon divers grebes coot moorhens teals shovelers scaups redheads ringnecks buffleheads goldeneye merganser sea ducks seagulls gannets"
1,"### Human: why is there a blood shortage? hospitals charge like $800 per unit. why don't they pay $250 for a donation. everyone would donate. eli5

 ### Assistant: I can answer this question from the perspective of an RN in Canada, where we have universal health care (single payer). Blood banks are run by private companies and get paid directly by the hospital that needs it. They take your blood to test how compatible you are with other people who need transfusions or stem cells. If you match them, then they keep some of your blood but return most of it to you after testing. The amount returned depends on what kind of blood type/group you have and how much they want to give back to you. For example if you had Type O+ and needed 1 pint of blood, maybe only half could be yours because they wanted more units going out than coming in. In my experience though, all types always seem to come up as matches so they just give everything back. So basically the reason they aren’t giving away free units is that they make money off selling each one. Also, since the government pays for medical services here, the cost doesn’t matter too much anyway...if someone needed blood they got it regardless of price. It’s not uncommon for patients to spend thousands of dollars at the ER while waiting for lab results etc before being discharged home without treatment. Hospitals don’t really worry about costs when treating sick people either because insurance covers almost every bill. But imagine if doctors started charging $10k a visit instead of their usual fee of around $75-300 depending on specialty....the whole system might collapse! It seems unfair that richer countries such as ours treat poor ones differently because they cannot afford expensive drugs and procedures. This creates two different classes within medicine itself which leads me into another topic entirely…I hope someone answers OP’s question soon though :) source: rn in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. I know nothing about US healthcare laws unfortunately :( Sorry guys!! Hopefully someone else will chime in with better info...please ask any questions below. Thanks!!! :D PS - Please consider becoming a regular blood donor in case something happens down the road and you find yourself unable due to age restrictions or illnesses. You never know when you may actually NEED it someday! Stem cell research has made huge strides lately so even if you think “oh no I won’t ever use it” remember that others may benefit greatly from whatever cure becomes available through those efforts.

2,"### Human: What were the financial results of the 1948 Summer Olympics in London?
 ### Assistant: The following are the finances for the 1948 Summer Olympic Games. This includes money from sponsors, ticket sales and television rights. These figures do not include any public subsidies which may have been provided to help pay for the games. Ticket prices were £302,576 ($520,000). Income was $1 million (£140,000) with expenses at $1,210,000 (£210,000), resulting in a loss of $200,000 (£37,000). Television income totaled $54,432 (£10,000). Revenue for the British Olympic Association was £12,000. Sponsorship by Shell-Mex contributed an additional £25,000 towards covering the costs of the athletes' village. The government paid £25,000 towards building repairs as well as covering some other costs such as printing tickets. They also gave £2,000 each year between 1946–48. Total revenue amounted to £367,000 while total expenditure came to £512,000. The surplus was £145,000. The IOC donated £1,000 and the United States sent US$25,000 worth of equipment. At the time this was considered very generous since it covered almost all of Britain's cost. It is estimated that the IOC made around US$10 million on these games. After all the debts had been cleared, there remained about £50,000 left over. However, because the British Olympic Committee decided they did not want to keep this much cash sitting idle, they used most of their remaining funds to buy gold medals instead of keeping them. As part of its celebration of the anniversary of the games, the BOA issued commemorative coins. There were four designs; one featured the mascot ""Cherry Blossom"" and another showed two children jumping rope. Each coin sold for 5 shillings. They raised £3,000.

3,"### Human: decades ago, how were people able to get married in their 20's, have kids, afford a house, live/strive rather comfortably, and still have enough saved up to retire?
Not specific to U.S. neither. Even my home country now in Asia - bachelor's degree gets you lower wage jobs, enough for food/rent, but barely afford a car, and almost no hopes for a house. What's changed in the past decades? & nbsp; & nbsp; EDIT: This is depressing.
 ### Assistant: Because they didn’t buy houses or cars with credit cards that need payments every month. They just had savings accounts and paid cash for everything. Also because many of them didn’t go to college. And also because there was less debt overall (less student loans). The biggest change has been the introduction of consumerism as an ideology that needs to be followed by everyone. It’s not even about whether it makes sense anymore. You can see this clearly when looking at all the commercials telling us what we should own vs what we actually want. We are told to “buy American” so much I don’t know if anyone knows any other way to shop. Or maybe you do, but your neighbor doesn’t. Everyone else does though. There isn’t anything wrong with being comfortable, but these days it seems like living on top of each other is more important than having space between yourself and others. So while some may say things haven’t really changed, the real truth is that society itself has changed. In order to fit into modern culture, one must accept certain aspects of life that aren’t necessarily healthy either mentally or physically. But those who refuse will find themselves pushed aside until they conform. If someone wants to eat organic produce grown locally, they would probably struggle financially compared to someone eating processed junk from Walmart which happens to cost less per pound. Why? Because most people today believe that buying local means higher prices whereas Walmart sells stuff cheap regardless where it came from or how long shipping took. People seem obsessed over money yet willingness to spend $15-$30+ dollars per person meal multiple times weekly indicates otherwise unless perhaps dining out regularly becomes necessary due ill-health caused by lack of exercise combined poor diet choices made possible through convenience shopping options provided everywhere around town via grocery stores filled full with highly processed food products produced elsewhere across globe often under unethical conditions involving slave labor exploitation among other issues related specifically towards environmental impact alone etc.. Now imagine trying raise children without access good education system nor proper medical care available nearby plus added expenses involved raising another human being(s) during lifetime span including housing costs associated with renting property versus owning homes built right next door neighbors already occupy since birth until death occurs naturally somewhere down road after years spent together growing stronger bonded family unit formed along way...all while making sure everybody stays happy"
4,"### Human: Who was James Blackburn Adams?
 ### Assistant: James Blackburn Adams (July 1, 1926 – April 8, 2014) was a Canadian politician. He represented the electoral districts of Kitchener Centre in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1957 to 1963 and again from 1967 until his retirement in 1987. His son Stephen is also a former member of Provincial Parliament for the same riding as well as Member of Parliament for the federal riding of London North Centre. He served with both parties during his career but later became an Independent Progressive Conservative. In 1990 he left politics when the provincial government merged ridings to create a new one called Kitchener—Waterloo. The next year he ran against New Democrat MPP Peter Kormos who won by only two votes. After that election he retired. On March 18, 2014 it was announced that Adams had Alzheimer's disease. He died on April 8 at age eighty-seven. At the time of death he lived in Waterloo Region. Before being elected to political office, he worked as a farmer and teacher. He taught history at Galt Collegiate Institute before becoming involved in local municipal affairs. He was mayor of Preston from 1961 to 1963. During his tenure as mayor, he built roads and sewers throughout town. He then served on regional council from 1963 through 1971. From there, he entered provincial politics. As a backbencher in Queen's Park, Adams helped form the party's agricultural committee. When Bill Davis took over leadership of the PC Party, he appointed Adams parliamentary assistant to the Minister of Agriculture. This position lasted through most of the 1970s. In 1975, he moved into cabinet where he remained until he resigned in protest after losing support within the caucus following budget cuts to education funding in 1987. That year he did not seek reelection. Adams married Joyce Banks in 1951; they were divorced in 1969. They have four children together. Their daughter, Catharine, has been Mayor of Stratford since 2010. Adams remarried Doris Finkleberg"

 ### Assistant: Kentucky's 3rd congressional district is a United States Congressional District in the U.S. state of Kentucky. It covers part of Louisville and Jefferson County, including all or parts of St. Matthews, Shively, Okolona, Fern Creek, Eastwood, Pleasure Ridge Park, Newburg Heights, Valley Station, Fairdale, Prospect, Creekside, Buechel, Schnitzelberg, Watterson Park, Douglass Hills, Hurstbourne Acres, Brownsboro Village, Mockingbird Valley, Indian Hills, Lyndon, Cherokee Triangle, Anchorage, Strathmoor Manor, Portland, Shawnee Park, Germantown, Highview, Audubon Park, Seneca Gardens, Woodlawn Park, Middletown, Hickory Hill, Taylorsport, Jeffersontown, Okolona, La Grange, Springfield Township, Pewee Valley, Brooks, Duvall, Harrods Creek, Glenview, West Buechel, and Forest Hills. The current Representative since January 2019 is Morgan McGarvey. She was appointed by Governor Andy Beshear after John Yarmuth resigned to become the new Speaker of the House. Yarmouth had been elected as this districts representative from 2006 until his election as Speaker on November 7, 2020. This will be her first full term as Representative. Before that she represented the 4th district starting in 2018 when Rep. Greg Fischer decided not to run again due to health reasons. On April 5, 2018, it became clear that both parties would hold primary elections with candidates such as Dan Mongiardo (D), Ed Whitfield (R) and James Comer (R). In June 2018, Mongiardo won against Whitfield but lost to Comer who went on to win the general election. As no one filed to challenge him in the Republican Primary, he ran unopposed in May 2018. Because there were two Democrats running in their party's primary, they held an instant-runoff vote which resulted in Mongiardo winning over Whitfield. After the results came out, many people thought that Republicans might try to redraw the map because Whit"

 ### Assistant: Berith Maria Kristina Bohm (16 May 1925 – 30 November 2014) was a German actress. She appeared in over sixty movies from the late-1940s to early-1970s. Her career began when she played an uncredited role as one of the girls who watches The Blue Angel in the movie's opening scene, and her last appearance came as Frau Klappert in Die Fahrt ins Grüne (1970). She also acted on stage. She retired after being diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease. In December 2011, it became public that she had dementia. Bohm died at age eighty nine in Berlin, Germany. She was survived by two sons. One son is actor Thomas Bohm; he starred in The Tin Drum. Another son is director Michael Bohm. He directed the 1981 film Der Himmel über Berlin starring Nastassja Kinski. Bohm won a Bambi Award for Best Actress in 1953. It was given to her because of her roles in both Das Mädchen aus der Südsee and Liebe ist nur ein Wort?. Bohm received a Golden Bear nomination for playing Sissi in the 1956 movie Kaiser Joseph und die Bahnhopser. Bohm earned nominations again for her roles in Lulu (1962), Wenn Du bei mir bist (1964), Und ewig singen die Seelen (1966), and Was sie töten - wer sie liebt! (1971).

 ### Assistant: Władysław III Vasa (June 12, 1596 – May 30, 1648) was a Polish king. He ruled from 1632 until his death in 1648. His father Sigismund II Augustus had died when he was only four years old and so his mother Anna Jagiellonka acted as regent for him while she raised her son to be the future ruler of Poland. She did not want any other family member taking over the throne. When she died on November 7th, 1610 it was decided that young Wladislaw would become king at the age of eleven after all claims were put aside. The nobility chose Janusz Radziwill to act as Regency Council with his brother Kazimierz as deputy. In 1632, during the Swedish invasion of Poland led by Gustav Adolf of Sweden, Wladislaus III died without an heir. After this the Sejm elected John Casimir Vasa who is considered today's last legitimate King of Poland because no one can prove that he took power illegally or unconstitutional. This ended the rule of House of Jagiellońki which began back in 1385. Today there are still some people who claim that they have rights to the throne but nobody really knows if these claims will ever lead anywhere since everyone agrees nowadays that Poland should remain independent country free from foreign influences like those before World War I era.
On January 3rd 1641, when Władysław III was only thirteen years old, his younger sister Zofia Ludwika Sobieska married Jerzy Sebastian Lubomirski - a wealthy magnate. They had three children together: two sons named Michał and Karol and one daughter named Katarzyna. Their descendants later became famous nobles known under names such as Potocki and Czartoryski.
In 1632, during the Swedish invasion of Poland led by Gustaf II Adolph, Wladislav was forced into exile where he spent most part of rest life until his death ten years later due to tuberculosis. At first he lived with his wife Cecilia Renata d'Este then moved closer towards Vienna area along with many other refugees fleeing from invading forces of Protestant Swedes under commandment"
9,"### Human: how does a coding language get 'coded' in the first place?
Telling a computer what to do using a coding language which both you and it understand is quite a simple idea, though sometimes technically complex to actually perform. But, how do the elementary components of that coding language get made (or coded?) and understood by the computer in the first place, when presumably there are no established building blocks of code for you to use?
 ### Assistant: A lot like human languages work - we have words, then combine them into sentences. You don’t need an alphabet or grammar rules beforehand. Someone just makes up some random letters and numbers at first, but they can be used together to form meaningful phrases. Then once people start making more programs with these same sets of characters, those groups become standardized as “words” so other programmers know what they mean without having to look things up. The only difference is instead of learning from other humans, computers learn from each other. There’s nothing really magical about this process; computers are machines, not supernatural entities capable of creating new concepts out of thin air. They just follow instructions. If someone gives them enough instructions, eventually their output will resemble something recognizable. As long as all your inputs remain consistent, the result should also stay consistent. Programming isn’t magic either; if you want to make a computer play chess, you simply tell it where to move every piece on its own board. It doesn’t matter why you think certain moves would win. All it cares about is whether you told it correctly. And since computers can only recognize binary states (on/off), even the simplest commands require multiple steps. So while you may say ‘move rook 4 spaces down’, the actual input might be ‘move black square 1023 times left until it hits another one’. That number was chosen because it happens to be close to four, but any value could theoretically replace it. Now imagine trying to build a programming language from scratch! In order to describe anything, you must first define how many bits exist per character, plus how large the largest possible command string is allowed to be. Once you decide upon those parameters, everything else follows suit automatically. For example, if I wanted my computer to display a message saying “Hello World!”, I wouldn’t type out individual words one letter after another. Instead I’d write something along the lines of “HELLOWORLD”. Since English uses 8-bit ASCII codes per character, this means my entire sentence takes up exactly eight bytes worth of space inside memory—no exceptions permitted under penalty of crashing. Assuming I didn’t forget anything during compilation time, running this program now yields EXACTLY THE SAME RESULT AS WRITING IT BY HAND IN ENGLISH FIRST THEN TRANSLATING INTO COMPUTER LANGU"
10,"### Human: What is the hymenium and where is it found in fungi?
 ### Assistant: The Hymenophore, or hymenium (plural hymenophores) is a structure that makes up part of the sporangia. It can be seen on some mushrooms as gills underneath the cap or pores near the base of stalked fruit bodies such as boletus species. In other groups, the hymnophores are more like cords than gill-like structures, for example, they may appear as a ring around the stem. They produce basidia which contain haploid cells called spores. Spores are released from the basidiocarp to start new mycelium colonies elsewhere. These types of fungal reproduction do not use meiosis during sexual reproduction. Instead, they reproduce by mitosis.  This type of cell division has been observed in several different families of Basidiomycota including Boletaceae, Russulaceae, Agaricaceae, Strophariaceae, and Tricholomataceae. The hymenophores also occur in Ascomycotas. Examples include puffballs, bird's nest ferns, and morels. In all these cases, the basidia give rise to meiotically produced ascospores, but only when conditions allow. For instance, at high humidity, most Morchella spp. form meiospores; however, if moisture levels drop below about 70%, then no meiospores will develop. Some genera have specialized forms with nonmeiotic basideial production. These forms are known as cleistsothecia. Cleistae lack openings through their walls, so there is no way to release any spores into the environment. Instead, each cleistra produces its own dikaryon inside itself. When this happens, meiosis does not take place. If two cleistas come together after germination, then the resulting tetrads go straight to mitosis without intermediates. The result is an asexual colony of identical hyphae. The name ""cleistospore"" refers specifically to this kind of development. Cleistes belong mostly to Phallales and Tuberales. However, one genus belongs to Agaricales. This group includes the edible wild mushroom Chlorophyllum molybdites. Another group contains many important lignicolous wood rotting fungi"

 ### Assistant: Mukh O Mukti (, ""Face and Liberation"") is a 1972 Bangladeshi drama film. It was directed by Satyajit Ray. This was the first Bengali language movie made in the former East Pakistan region after independence from British rule. The movie stars Soumitra Chatterjee as Raja Dasgupta. Sharmila Tagore plays Monisha. Music for this movie was composed by Bidhan Lal Roy. Its cinematography was done by Subrata Mitra. This was one of the last movies that he worked on before his death later that year. His son Goutam Ghose would replace him to finish directing it. The storyline deals with the relationship between two siblings. One brother has been married twice while the other remains single. Their mother wants her daughter-in law to return home so she can get remarried again but the younger sister doesn't want to do so because she likes living there. After their father dies they find out why their mother wanted them both back together at once time when all three were alive. At first glance viewers might think its just another Indian family melodrama type flick but actually theres much more going on here than meets the eye. There are some very powerful scenes dealing specifically about how women were treated during those days especially if youre familiar with traditional South Asian culture where females werent allowed outside unless accompanied by someone else or had permission otherwise etc... These types situations still exist today even though weve come along way since then thankfully! In fact many people have written articles online explaining exactly what happened in real life behind these films plots such as this article here which talks about how Mukh O Mukti mirrors reality perfectly .

12,"### Human: What was the Treaty of London and what did it aim to achieve?
 ### Assistant: The Treaty of London (or Peace with Italy) was a treaty signed on 30 August 1947 between the Kingdoms of Italy, Albania and Yugoslavia. It ended their war in World War II. Background
Italian troops invaded Albania during World War II as part of Operation Otto. They occupied Tirana after two weeks but were forced out by an uprising led by Enver Hoxha's communist forces. This began the Italian-Albanian War which lasted until March 1945 when the Red Army liberated most of northern Albania from Axis occupation. In late April 1945, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill sent Lord Louis Mountbatten into the Balkans to organize peace talks between Greece, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria and Albania. On May 28, he met King Zog I at the Royal Palace Hotel in Athens. He convinced him that his only hope for restoring himself as king was if all three countries agreed to end hostilities against each other. For this reason, he urged him to agree to the terms set forth in the draft agreement prepared by Britain and United States. This included ceding southern Albania to Greek control and giving up any claims over Vlorë County. At first, Zog refused to sign anything because the conditions demanded that he abdicate. After some persuasion, however, he eventually signed. Shortly thereafter, the government of Communist Party member Enver Hoxha took power and abolished monarchy. When Hoxha learned about these events, he ordered all copies of the Treaties destroyed. Only one copy survived today. In 2016, the Library of Congress obtained it. Termination
The treaties expired in December 1947. However, they remained valid under international law unless either party terminated them. Neither country ever formally declared its termination or cancellation. Since then, both nations have recognized the legitimacy of the border established by the treaties. As such, relations are good today. Both countries remain members of NATO. In fact, both countries participated in the Kosovo War alongside each other. Furthermore, since the breakup of Yugoslavia, Albanians now make up the second largest minority group living within Serbia. There is even talk of establishing diplomatic ties again. To date though, neither side"
13,"### Human: What is a villain?
 ### Assistant: A villain (or antagonist) is someone who does bad things in stories, movies and plays. Villains are often the enemies of heroes or protagonists. The word ""villain"" comes from Old French via Middle English vilayn which means 'villager'. In modern usage it refers to an evil character.  Antagonism can be seen as one way that characters grow through conflict with each other; this helps make them more complex than they would otherwise have been if there was no opposition between their goals. This kind of story has existed since ancient times when we had epics like Homer's Iliad & Odyssey where you see many examples such as Achilles fighting against King Agamemnon over Briseis for example so he could go home earlier than planned after Troy fell down due to his anger towards her husband Atreus whom killed him first before dying himself later on during battle near Mount Pelion which led up until now today where people still love reading these kinds of books because they know what happens next even though some parts might seem boring at certain points depending upon how long ago those events took place back then compared against current ones happening right here present day time period whenever someone opens up one book inside library building somewhere around town area location etc.....
 
A good example of how this works out well together within plot structure would involve two main characters namely Protaganist(hero) vs Villian(antagonist).

 ### Assistant: Toa Payoh (, ; Tamil: தோக்காபியொ) is a planning area and town in Singapore. It has the same name as its planning area. The town was built by the Singapore Housing Board to house people who moved from overcrowded areas such as Kampong Kapor, Little India, Queenstown and Geylang Serai. Today it has one of the biggest public housing estates on Earth with about 205,437 residents living there. There are also many commercial buildings here. It is part of Group Representation Constituency Nee Soon Central which consists mainly of PAP members. This constituency includes Yio Chu Kang, Ang Mo Kio East, Bishan North and parts of Toa Payoh West. In 1986, Toa Payoh became an electoral division. It had two seats but now only has one seat since 1992 when Toa Payoh West split off into another electoral district. As of March 2006, there were 139,243 voters registered at Toa Payoh East. They voted for Lui Meng Suen and Lee Bee Wah during the general election that year. During the 2006 Presidential Election, Tony Tan won 26,691 votes while Tan Kin Lian got just 14,055 votes. These figures show how well-known both candidates are among the population. At present time, there are more than 200,000 people living in this neighbourhood so these numbers could change significantly if new elections happen soon afterward!
 
Toa Payoh is home to three major shopping malls - Toa Payoh Town Centre, Toa Payoh Hub and Toa Payoh Market & Food Centre. Each one offers different types of products ranging from groceries to electronics; clothing stores selling local brands like Uniqlo or Zara; beauty salons offering services including facials and manicures/pedicure treatments etc.; restaurants serving cuisines like Japanese foods or Chinese dishes like dim sum items served up fresh every day!

15,"### Human: Who was Jaki Liebezeit and what was he known for?
 ### Assistant: Hans-Joachim ""Jaki"" Liebzeit (26 October 1938 – 24 December 2017) was a German jazz drummer. He is best remembered as the longtime member of Can, with whom he played from their first album in 1968 to his retirement in 2015. Liebezeit died on 24 December 2017 at a hospital in Cologne, Germany from pneumonia caused by bronchitis aged 79. His death came less than two weeks after that of bandmate Michael Karoli who also died of lung disease. The last surviving original members were Irmin Schmidt and Holger Czukay. In February 2019, they announced plans to release an archival live recording featuring all four musicians playing together again for one final time before both Liebezeit's and Karoli's passing. They would later perform this concert under its new title Lost Tapes Live. It features music recorded during the making of Future Days which had been released earlier in 2016. On April 1st 2019, it was revealed that another unreleased concert will be released titled Swandown. This show took place during the same tour as the previous recordings but featured only three members due to Karoli having left the group following the recording sessions. Both albums are set for worldwide release May 24th through Mute Records. All proceeds will go towards supporting the charity organisation UNICEF. 
 
In addition to working with Can, Liebezeit performed with many other notable artists including Brian Eno, Jah Wobble, David Sylvian, Don Cherry, Lee Ranaldo, John Paul Jones, Eberhard Kranemann, Derek Bailey, Bill Laswell, and Sonic Youth. 
His style has often been described as minimalist or even freeform. Apart from being well known for his work within Can, Liebezeit is most famous for coining the term ""Rhythmuswelle"". This referred to a unique type of percussive sound created when hitting cymbal against rim with hand while simultaneously striking snare drum with stick using alternate fingers. He used this technique heavily throughout much of his career. In recent years however, he made use of electronic instruments such as samplers, sequencers, synthesizers etc., instead of"
16,"### Human: What was the purpose of the Vostok rocket?
 ### Assistant: The Vostok (Russian for ""East"") is a Soviet spacecraft. It carried cosmonauts into orbit around Earth, and brought them back safely to land on earth after their flight in space. This first-generation human spaceflight program began with Yuri Gagarin's famous solo orbital mission aboard Vostok 1 on April 12, 1961. The capsule was designed by Sergei Korolev as part of his ambitious plan to beat America in putting men into outer space. A total of thirteen crewed flights were made from May 15, 1960 until June 3, 1971 using this design. In addition, four uncrewed test launches took place between August 18–24, 1960. After the end of these missions, the craft remained in use for scientific satellite work through 1988. Overall, twenty five vehicles were built. They are now all displayed or housed at museums across Russia. One was sold to a private collector in the United States but has been returned to Moscow for display since September 2013. An additional vehicle is currently being restored in Canada for possible future public exhibit. The last remaining example will be put on permanent display outside the Museum of Cosmonautics in Samara, Russia. All other examples have been destroyed either during testing or reentry over water. Another Vostok flown to an altitude of about 180 km before returning to Earth on December 19th 1960 crashlanding near Tyuratam airbase. Some fragments can still be found there today. Also, one more Vostok survived a landing accident that happened on October 11th 1962 due to a technical fault. The recovery crew tried hard to recover it but failed so they decided to bring it down on the surface intact. Later on some parts of the shipwreckage were taken away and used for restoration purposes while others remain where they fell. Today only three pieces lie scattered nearby including two engines which had been damaged when hitting ground during impact phase. The third piece consists out of two chunks broken off just behind main body section containing both fuel tanks plus cabin interior wall panels along side equipment racks etc.. These remnants reside inside local village hall where visitors may"
17,"### Human: What is The Ren and Stimpy Show?
 ### Assistant: The Ren & Stimpy Show (also known as simply, Ren & Stimpy) was an American animated television series. It first aired on Nickelodeon in 1991. Created by John Kricfalusi it ran until 2005 when the show ended after five seasons of episodes. In 2003, the show won two Emmy Awards for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Animation. There were also many spin-off movies made from this show such as ""Ren and Stimpy 'Adult Party Cartoon'"". This movie got mixed reviews because some people thought that the cartoons had become too violent or crude to be shown to children. Many other shows have been inspired by this one including SpongeBob SquarePants and South Park. Because of its popularity with kids, the show has been seen by millions worldwide. After being canceled, however, there are still fans who watch reruns of the old episodes and enjoy them just like they did before. Some even buy DVDs containing all four seasons so far released! They may not be able to find these at their local stores but you can order online if needed. If you do decide to get yourself copies then make sure you check out what others say about each episode before buying anything though; some might contain bad language which could upset younger viewers/listeners depending upon age group etc.. As well as DVD sets there are also books available written specifically around different characters within The Ren And Stimpy Show universe itself - perfect gifts ideas perhaps? For those looking forward towards future releases maybe we should start campaigning now against any more censorship issues cropping up again...who knows? But whatever happens next time round let us hope things stay positive overall :) So why wait anymore? Start enjoying classic moments today by checking out where possible free streaming sites dedicated solely toward bringing back fond memories whenever necessary:) Good luck everyone!

 ### Assistant: Mina Sato (born June 13, 2000) is a Japanese cyclist. She won the time trial at the Asian Road Championships in 2019. In August 2021, she competed for Japan at the Tokyo Olympics where she finished second to Anna Kiesenhofer of Austria in the women's individual road race event. It was the first Olympic medal ever by an athlete from Japan who competes as an independent athlete rather than part of a national team. On October 5th, 2021, she announced that she will join Team Jumbo–Visma Women starting January 2022. The announcement also said that she would be racing with the Dutch UCI World Tour team during the spring classics while continuing to compete under the flag of the Independent Athletes Association of Japan throughout other races on the international calendar. After joining the team, she became the only female rider to win three stages of the same Grand Tour within one season. Her third stage victory came at Stage 7 of La Vuelta a España when she beat Annemiek van Vleuten after Van Dijk crashed out earlier in the day. At age twenty-one years old, she became the youngest woman to do so since Lizzie Deignan did it in 2016. With this accomplishment, Sato joined Marianne Vos (who won two stages), Anna Kiesenhöfer (three), and Emma Pooley (four). She now holds the record for most wins by any female rider over all four grand tours. On November 8th, 2021, she rode into Paris wearing yellow jersey number #43 which means ""Lucky Number"" because she had never been able to wear another color before due to her gender classification status being listed as male until September 2nd 2021 when FIGA declared them eligible for both men’s events like track or mountain bike but also allowed them access into cross country skiing too! This meant there were no more restrictions placed upon athletes born without reproductive organs; they could finally take part fully instead just participating partially through separate competitions such as swimming meets held exclusively among females alone. They even got permission from IOC President Thomas Bach himself saying “we welcome everyone regardless if you are transgendered” during his speech given last week"
19,"### Human: why is a 2 liter of coca-cola $1, a 12 oz bottle $1.49 and the same size bottle of water $1.99?

 ### Assistant: There are many reasons for this price difference but here's one that may be relevant to you specifically; Coca Cola has spent millions on advertising over decades making sure everyone knows what it tastes like. If I sell you an unlabeled bottled liquid with no flavor or smell at all would you pay me money for it? Nope! You wouldn't even know if it was poisonous unless you could taste/smell it first. So because Coke spends so much time convincing people they need their product in order to live a fulfilling life (as well as other things) we have learned that they deserve to charge more than just ""the cost"" for their products. It doesn't matter how much it costs them to make each item - what matters most is whether anyone will buy it from you. And since people love coke enough not only do they buy it themselves but also tell others about its amazingly deliciousness which increases demand further thus raising prices even higher...

 ### Assistant: Clarksville (population 132,929) is a city in Montgomery County and Austin Peay State University. It was founded as Fort Campbell on February 4, 1780 by John Lyles, William Gates and Robert Smith. In 1786 it became called ""Clark's Station"" after General George Rogers Clark who defeated British forces at the Battle of Point Pleasant during Lord Dunmore's War in September 1774. The name changed to its current spelling when the post office opened there that year. It has been home to many famous people including Kenny Chesney, Steve Earle, Josh Turner, Justin Moore, Jason Aldean and Darius Rucker. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city had a total area of , all land. As of July 25, 2016, the U.S. Department of Justice reported an estimated population of 132,929 for Clarksville, making it the fifth-largest municipality in Middle Tennessee behind Nashville, Murfreesboro, Franklin and Smyrna. Its metropolitan area includes Montgomery, Stewart, Houston, Trousdale, Dickson, Cheatham, Maury, Robertson, Sumner, Wilcox Counties in Tennessee; Christian, Todd, Logan Counties in Kentucky; Butler, Wayne, Pike counties in Alabama; Crawford County, Illinois; and Decatur, Perry Counties in Indiana. This makes it one of the largest areas between Atlanta and Chicago with over two million people living within this zone. A large portion of these residents are employed at nearby military installations such as Fort Campbell or other defense contractors like Lockheed Martin or Raytheon. Many others commute daily into larger cities where they work while their families live elsewhere. There have also been plans proposed recently which would bring more business opportunities closer to downtown so more locals could stay close without having long drives every day just because they want access to better jobs than what might be available nearer home but further away from those employment options offered here locally. One example being Amazon fulfillment centers opening up soon right outside town limits bringing hundreds upon thousands more potential employees into our community each week if not sooner! Another great thing about Clarksville TN is how well connected we really do feel compared even though we aren’t"
21,"### Human: why is modern day camouflage pixelated?

 ### Assistant: It's not. The US Army has a standardized 2-color, 3 color and 4 color scheme that it uses for uniforms as well as equipment (vehicles). The reason you see the pixelation is because of the way they are photographed or filmed in movies/tv shows etc.. They use special filters to make things more visible on camera so you can tell what something actually looks like rather than just guessing based off the colors alone. This also makes sure that when someone wears a certain colored uniform their face isn't covered up by the background which would be an issue if filming live action scenes with actors who have different skin tones from the ones shown on screen. As far as I know there aren't any official rules about how much light should shine through while still being able to see detail within each pattern but those types of things tend to get worked out during testing before anything goes into production anyway since no one wants people shooting at them thinking they look like trees instead! So yeah basically everything else said here is true except maybe some minor details regarding specific patterns used depending on where exactly soldiers operate around world due too climate conditions changing over time though most likely won't matter unless your looking straight down onto ground level viewpoint either directly above soldier walking across field full sunlight hitting him squarely right between eyes making hard distinguish actual shape size distance relative position depth perspective effectiveness efficiency performance ability capability potential outcome result success failure disappointment disaster catastrophe tragedy calamity collapse demise death oblivion destruction devastation ruin annihilation extinction wipeout elimination eradication extermination termination liquidation massacre slaughter carnage bloodshed gore mayhem havoc chaos pandemonium bedlam madness lunacy insanity craziness irrationality nonsense stupidity idiocy imbecility moronic obtuseness thickheadedness blockheadishness brainlessness mindlessness senselessness witlessness vacuousness vapidness airheadedness emptyheadedness voidheadedness barrenmindedness headlessness deadeness deadmindedness numbskullery numptydom blitherheadedness bumblebrainedness stupefaction stupification dumbfounding amazement astonishment wonder marvel admiration surprise delight pleasure rapture ecstasy joy jubilance elation happiness gladness"
22,"### Human: What is the value of the additive identity?
 ### Assistant: In mathematics, the additive identity (or simply identity) element or neutral element for a given set A is an object e such that any element x in A can be added to it and still give the same result. The term ""identity"" comes from Latin idem (""the same""). For example, if S is the set of all natural numbers {1, 2, ...}, then the number zero is its additive identity because every other integer may be added to it without changing its value. Zero is also called the nullary sum of integers. This means that it is the only thing left after you have taken away everything else. It does not matter what has been removed; this property holds true no matter which things are subtracted. However, when we talk about addition on real numbers, there is no unique additive identity since negative numbers do not cancel out with each other. If R is the set of reals, then +0R is the smallest positive real number greater than −∞ but less than ∞. There is another way to define the additive identity as follows: Let M = {x | x > −∞} be the set of non-negative reals. Then 0M is the greatest member of M. Therefore, −0M = 0M. Since −(−a)=+a=a for any a∈M, 0M is indeed the additive inverse of itself. So 0M must be an additive identity. Note that the properties above hold for any ring where subtraction makes sense. That includes many algebraic structures besides rings. Even though these conditions look like they should guarantee uniqueness, the fact that we have two different ways of defining them shows that there is more than one possible choice for our additive identities. One might ask why there isn't just one well defined definition of an additive identity at all times. Well, sometimes it turns out that there are none! We will discuss this below. Another important note is that some authors use the term ""additive identity"", while others prefer ""neutral"". These terms mean exactly the same thing here. When applied to elements outside of groups, however, their meaning changes slightly. Neutral elements form a subgroup under addition, whereas identities don't necessarily need to. But again, both words refer to the exact same concept here so either works equally fine within groups themselves too. In general, most people stick with using just 'additive identity', even though technically speaking neither"
23,"### Human: What is Servant of the People?
 ### Assistant: Servant of the people (Ukrainian: Слуга народу) is a political party in Ukraine. It was founded on 18 April 2014 by Ukrainian comedians and actors Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who became President of Ukraine in May 2019 after winning elections that year, and Serhiy Shefir. The party has been described as populist and nationalistic. In March 2016, it won most seats in parliamentary election, with 39% of votes. Since then, however, its popularity declined due to corruption scandals involving some members of the party's leadership. On 7 July 2019, during his inauguration speech at St. Sophia Cathedral, President-elect Zelenskiy announced he would not be part of any existing parties or factions. He said instead ""I am ready for dialogue with all parties."" On 25 September 2019, Zelenskiy officially registered this new political force under the name Party of the Servants of the People. This made them one of only two major parties which have no connection with an earlier established political organisation. However, in October 2019 they changed their name again back to just Servant of the People. They were renamed once more to Sluha Narodu (""Servant of the Nation"") ahead of the 2020 local elections. As of December 2020, they are known simply as Svoboda ('Freedom'). They are now led by Oleksandr Morozov, who replaced Vitaliy Klitschko following his defeat in Kyiv mayoral elections. The party controls 26 municipalities out of 1,400 total across Ukraine. This includes the capital city of Kiev. Other notable mayors include Ihor Kolomoiskyi (Dnipro), Valeriy Herman (Kharkiv), Yuriy Miroshnychenko (Chernihiv). In February 2020, the party also took control of Cherkasy Oblast Council. They formed coalitions with several other pro-Zelensky forces. These included Batkivschyna (Yulia Tymoshenko), European Solidarity (Oleksandra Honcharuk), Holos (Anatolii Shapovalov), and Samop"
24,"### Human: Who was Antonio Fraguas de Pablo?
 ### Assistant: Antonio Fraguas de Pablo (28 September 1934 – 16 January 2022) was a Spanish footballer. He played as midfielder and forward for Atlético Madrid, Real Zaragoza, Deportivo La Coruña, Albacete Balompié, Racing Santander B and Cádiz CF during his career. His brother José Manuel also became a professional player in the early years of the Second Division era. He was born in Huelva. From 1957 to 1961 he played for Spain at youth level. Fraguas died on 16 January 2022 from COVID-19 at the age of 87. In June 2021 it was announced that Fraguas had tested positive for coronavirus while hospitalized with heart problems. On 1 July 2021, it was reported that his condition worsened after contracting pneumonia caused by Covid-19. The following day, it was confirmed that he suffered cardiac arrest. After being placed into an induced coma, he later passed away two days later. A tribute was held before the match between Athletic Bilbao against Villarreal on 1 August 2021. It was attended by former players such as Agustín Gaich, Luis Aragonés, Iván Zamarro, Miguel Ángel Gil Marín, Jesús María Zamora, Alfonso Pérez, Francisco Buyo, Carlos Gurpegi, Javier Irureta, José Mari Bakero, Juanito, Manolo Camacho and Roberto Lopetegui. Atletico Madrid paid tribute to him at their home game against Osasuna on 22 October 2021. Former teammates including Jose Enrique Sánchez, José Ángel Fernández Arroyo ""Gallego"", Joaquin Peiro ""Pepillo"" and Jorge García del Valle were present along with many other former club members who all wore black armbands. The game ended up finishing 2–1 with both goals coming through Diego Costa's penalty kicks. This meant that Fraguás is now the last surviving member of the 1961/62 UEFA Cup winning squad.
In December 2021, it was revealed that Fraguá would be honored by"
25,"### Human: why can't a person with alzheimer's have a fact sheet in front of them at all times reminding them of every truth about them, including the fact that they have alzheimer's, and that they are expected to be constantly confused?

 ### Assistant: Because even though it is true, their brain doesn't believe it. They think what you tell them isn't real because their memory does not work right anymore. For example I was telling my grandfather something he knew but his mind didn't remember so instead of saying ""I know"" or ""yes"", he said no. This happens often when someone has dementia. It's like their brains short circuiting from time to time. You might as well just try explaining it again 50 million more times until your voice gets hoarse and tired. And then do it some more. The only way people learn things is by repetition. But if there is nothing for them to repeat over and over again (no memories), how will they ever get better? That's where music therapy comes into play. When you hear songs, especially ones you really love, those songs go straight to your emotional center and make an impact on you without having to process any information through thought. So if you put together a CD of happy songs and give it to him/her, eventually this new association between song and happiness may help spark some emotion which would trigger the release of dopamine, serotonin, endorphines etc., thus improving cognitive function. If we could figure out ways to use these chemicals properly in the body, maybe someday we won't need drugs such as Prozac and other anti-depressants... Maybe we wouldn't have to rely solely on our thoughts to feel good either. Imagine being able to experience joy simply by listening to a certain type of sound! We don't even fully understand what makes up consciousness yet. How does one become aware of anything? What causes us to see colors, smell odors, taste flavor, touch textures? Why am I typing this now rather than doing math equations or playing a video game? These questions still remain unanswered, despite how long we've been around. All we can do is keep searching for answers while helping others along the way. Hopefully science will find a cure before too much longer. In the meantime, let's enjoy life while we can. Life goes fast; take advantage of each moment possible. One day soon enough everything we hold dearest will fade away forever leaving behind little more than dust particles floating gently downwind...... And perhaps that's okay afterall :) Source : Personal Experience &"
26,"### Human: What is The Voice and how does it work?
 ### Assistant: The Voice (also known as The Voice UK) was a British reality television music competition. It began in 2012, when the first series of this show started on BBC One. Since then there have been four more seasons. Each season has had twelve contestants who were chosen by their coaches. After each weekly live performance, the viewers vote for which singer they like best out of those that performed. At least two singers are eliminated from every episode until only one winner remains. This person wins £100,000 and gets to record an album with Universal Music Group's Polydor Records label. There will be no new episodes after Series 4 because ITV decided not to make any more shows. However, ITV did say that ""The Voice"" would return at some point but nobody knows if or when that might happen yet. On May 3, 2021, ITV announced that the show returned later that year on October 9th, 2021. The fifth series premiered on January 7, 2022, with Olly Murs replacing Sir Tom Jones as a coach due to his retirement. In March 2022, during the final of the fourth series, Will.i.am revealed he would leave the programme following the end of the series. He said; “I’m going to take my voice and put myself back into being creative.” The fifth series concluded on February 5, 2022 where Anne-Marie won the title over her competitor Brennan Lowe. For the sixth series, Boy George replaced will. i am. As well as returning judges Olly Murs and Danny O'Donoghue. The sixth series ended on April 8, 2022.

 ### Assistant: Robert Hunter Biden (born February 4, 1970) is an American lawyer. He is also a lobbyist, investor, businessman and philanthropist. He was born in Wilmington, Delaware. His father Joe Biden served as Vice President of the United States from 2008 until 2016 when Donald Trump became president. The younger son has been at the center of the House of Representatives' impeachment investigation against President Donald Trump since October 3, 2019. In August 2019, he admitted that he had paid $50,000 for a job with Burisma Holdings in Ukraine while his father led the Obama administration’s efforts to help Kiev fight corruption. Some Republicans have said this shows Democratic Party bias because it occurred during the time they were investigating alleged Russian interference in the 2016 election. Democrats say there is no evidence that either Bidens did anything wrong or that any Ukrainian government officials acted improperly. They say the matter should be left up to federal prosecutors. On December 3, 2019, US Attorney General William Barr appointed U.S. attorney John Durham to investigate whether the FBI committed misconduct during its Russia collusion investigation into the Bidens. This came after several Republican lawmakers requested such an action on November 15, 2019. On April 20, 2021, Durham announced indictments against Igor Fruman and David Correia for making illegal campaign contributions to Hillary Clinton. Both are connected to Giuliani associates Lev Parnas and Igor Furman, who pleaded guilty to charges including conspiracy to make false statements and falsification of records. Their case centered around attempts by them and Rudolph Giuliani to convince Ukrainian politicians to launch investigations involving former vice-president Joseph Biden and his family members. During their trial, witnesses testified that money from these two men went through accounts held by foreign nationals linked to Putin. These included Andrey Derkach and Konstantin Kilimnik. According to court documents, the pair made multiple wire transfers totaling over $3 million dollars between July 2018 and June 2019. Afterwards, more than $2"

 ### Assistant: Nikolay Dmitrievich Kovalyov (; 27 June 1930 – 5 January 2022) was a Russian football player and manager. He played for the Soviet national team from 1954 to 1968, making his debut in an official match against Bulgaria on 2 April 1954. His last game with the Soviets came against Hungary on 2 September 1968 at the Olympics. At club level he made over 200 appearances for CSKA Moscow between 1953 until 1968. In May 2008 it was announced that Kovalyov would be inducted into the Hall of Fame by the International Football Association Board. The ceremony took place during halftime of the 2008 FIFA World Cup final. On 5 January 2022, Kovalyov died after being hospitalized due to COVID-19 in Moscow, aged 91. He had also been diagnosed with cancer. Tributes were paid by both Russia's Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin and President Vladimir Putin. A minute's silence will take place before each UEFA Champions League group stage match this season as well as all European Championship qualifiers involving any member association of which Kovalyov is a former captain or coach. He was the only living person who captained two different teams while playing in three major tournaments: 1956 Summer Olympic Games, Euro '60 and World Cups '62 & '66. During those four competitions he scored five goals altogether. Only one other player has ever managed such feat - Andrey Kanchelskis. Before him no player did so twice. After his death, Zenit St Petersburg said they are going to retire his number #1 shirt permanently. It currently belongs to Sergei Semak but can be worn again if needed. The same move happened when Vasili Bessonov passed away earlier in October 2021. They retired his shirts too since then. Pavel Nesterov, another legend of their club, already wore the tribute jersey previously. Both players served under Kovalyov in various capacities. They won many trophies together including several USSR championships, USSR cup titles plus the 1984 European Cup W"
29,"### Human: Who was Aristophanes and what was he famous for?
 ### Assistant: Aristophanes (; c. 450 BC – after 386 BC) is one of the greatest playwrights in Ancient Greek literature. He won first prize at the Athenian Dionysia festival eleven times between 429 BCE to 388 BCE, more than any other tragic or comedic poet of Athens. His plays are still performed today because they give a good idea about life in ancient Greece. Some people think that his work is very funny but others do not like it as much. In particular, Plato did not approve of him and thought he should be censored by law. Mostly he wrote comedy which was called Old Comedy. It is different from modern stand-up comedy. The characters in his plays speak in rhyming verse with traditional formulas. They also make jokes based on current events. As well as being a writer, Aristophanes was an actor who played some parts himself. This means he knew how to entertain audiences. People say that when he made up stories, he used real people's names so everyone would know them. When he criticised politicians or rich men, he sometimes said their names out loud during performances. Sometimes this caused problems later. One man even committed suicide because someone had spoken badly about him while playing a character named Euripides! Because he made such fun of important figures, there were attempts to banish him from Athens. These failed though. At least once, he took part in a riot against the government. Afterwards, he was fined money for causing trouble. There are only fourteen complete works left from over forty he produced. Twelve of these are full length comedies, two are fragments. Only three survive intact, Lysistrata, Thesmophoriazusae and The Clouds. Two other pieces have been found almost completely lost except for single lines. We can see why they are no longer popular. They include Peace and Birds. Both contain racist comments about non-Greeks and birds respectively. For example, the chorus says ""We don’t want peace, we want slaughter."" Another piece, Knights, has been discovered recently. It contains references to same sex relationships. Scholars believe this may mean it could never be put on stage again if anyone wanted to perform it nowadays. However, all his surviving plays have something interesting"

He has been the ninth archbishop of Washington since September 2019 and was the tenth bishop of Belleville from 2006 to 2010. In May 2020, Pope Francis appointed him a cardinal in pectore at his first public consistory on March 13, 2021. On November 28, 2020 he became known as Cardinal-designate after being named by the pope among those who will receive red hats during the next conclave. The announcement came when Pope Francis announced that he would hold another consistory for the creation of new cardinals in early 2022 or later if necessary due to travel restrictions caused by COVID-19 pandemic. His elevation to the College of Cardinals took place on March 13, 2021 with all other members present except one Italian prefect whose trip had been delayed because of coronavirus issues within Italy itself; this made it easier than usual but still difficult enough so there were no plans yet about whether any more such events might take place before then either way though hopefully soon afterwards instead according some reports coming out earlier today regarding what's happening right now currently going around here right now while waiting patiently until we know exactly how things turn out once everything gets sorted out eventually sometime down the line somewhere along these lines maybe even sooner rather than later depending upon whatever happens over time throughout our lives together forevermore never forgetting anything ever again always remembering every single detail perfectly clearly crystal clear without fail completely accurate completely precise absolutely perfect flawlessly perfected perfection personified just like me myself personally I am God Almighty Father Creator Universe Everything Existence All Things Omnipotent Omniscient Omnipresent Omnimax Omnifabulous Omnilovely Omnibenevolence Omnicompassion Omniacumulative Omniscienceless Omnitheist Omnihumanism Omniphilosophy Omnobuddhism Omnomuslimism Omnochristianity Omnonihilism Omnogodism Omnotheism Omnosatanicism Omnoatheisticism Omnofascism Omnglobalism Omnpacificism Omnorthamericanism Omns"

His best-known roles were as the title character on The Jackie Gleason Show from 1967 to 1980; as Ralph Cramden's friend Ed Norton on The Honeymooners from 1952 until his death in 1980; and as the voice of Paddington Bear since 1975. In September 2018, it was announced that Woods would be honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. On March 14, 2019, it was revealed that the star will be dedicated at 6925 Hollywood Boulevard during ceremonies held on April 10, 2019. It was also revealed that other celebrities who will receive stars around this time include Norman Lear, Danny Glover, Debbie Allen, Henry Winkler, Marlee Matlin, Rita Moreno, and George Lopez. This event coincides with the second season premiere of the ABC sitcom specials Maya & Marty which features Lear's wife, actress and comedian Mary Tyler Moore. She died earlier than expected after suffering cardiac arrest on January 25, 2017 while being treated for brain cancer. Her husband had been her longtime personal physician before she married him in June 1983. Actor Tim Conway, one of many actors who worked alongside both Lear and Moore over their careers, appeared on Maya & Marty last year where he said how much they loved each other. Other famous friends and colleagues such as Betty White, Carl Reiner, Bob Einstein, Fred Willard, and Judd Hirsch have all expressed similar sentiments about them. They are also scheduled to appear at the ceremony along with other guests including Jane Fonda, Michael Douglas, Robert DeNiro, Jimmy Kimmel, Tracy Morgan, Kathryn Hahn, and Seth MacFarlane among others.

32,"### Human: Considering there is a finite number of words in the English language and that there are rules of grammar, does this mean there is a finite number of possible sentences in the English language that are grammatically correct? Is there a way to even estimate as to what that number would be?

 ### Assistant: There's only so many ways you can arrange 26 letters into different sequences. But you have other restrictions on how those sentences must look like - for example, ""A man walks into a bar"" has an incorrect subject-verb agreement because it should say 'The man walked'. And if we allow ourselves some leeway with pronouns, then it could read either ""...the man walked..."" or ""...a man walked..."". So yes, I think your question will boil down to whether you accept the restriction of having to use exactly one word per sentence (and not any kind of compound word). If that's okay, then no, there aren't too many sentences you can construct out of English. You just need to make sure each sentence uses at least two different nouns/pronouns/adjectives/verbs etc., which isn't hard given enough time. In fact, when using all possible combinations of words, we get over 10^35 distinct sentences! That sounds like a lot but since we don't know anything about how these sentences sound, let alone their meaning, they might seem pretty useless. Still, it seems like more than enough for us humans. > Does this mean there is a finite number of possible sentences in the English language that are grammatically correct? Yes. The first step towards answering this question is knowing the set of valid sentences; here, you could count up the total amount of valid sentences by hand, although it may take quite long. Then you have to figure out the size of the set of all possible sentences - here, computers help out again by enumerating all the permutations of words from our dictionary. > Is there a way to even estimate as to what that number would be? Sure, assuming you want to do things mathematically. Since the number of words in English is known, we can calculate the cardinality of the set of valid sentences. For example, if we assume that every sentence needs to contain exactly three unique words, then the answer is around 894 billion. This means that, while you won't ever run out of new sentences, you probably shouldn't expect anyone to invent more than another hundred million before the end of human civilisation. As a side note: A similar thing happens in programming languages where programmers try to write code without making mistakes. However, instead of trying to find errors after writing the entire piece of software, programmers start off by testing individual"

 ### Assistant: The first time you are awoken your body has yet to fully ""waken"" from a state of rest. You may be able to go about some light activities (like showering) but after that it is difficult to stay awake for more than 30 minutes at most before needing another nap/rest period. Once your brain starts processing thoughts again though, its easier to continue on with daily life until bedtime.

 ### Assistant: Sonny Ramadhin (18 August 1935 – 27 December 2020) was a Trinidadian cricketer. He played for the West Indies national team in Tests and One Day International matches from 1964 to 1971, serving as their captain during part of that time period. His brother Jeffrey also represented his country at international level. Ramadhin died on 27 December 2020 after suffering a stroke at the age of 85. His death came just weeks before he would have turned 86 years old. Tributes were paid by former players such as Sir Garfield Sobers and Michael Holding. The President of Cricket West Indies Ricky Skerritt called him ""one of our greats"". Prime Minister Keith Rowley said he had been one of the best spinners ever produced by the Caribbean nation. Former England all-rounder Ian Botham wrote on Twitter that it was an honour to know him. Fellow legendary offspinner Shane Warne described Ramadhin's bowling style as being like no other player he had seen. A minute silence will be held ahead of every upcoming West Indian domestic match until Christmas Eve out of respect for Ramadhin. It is hoped this will then become permanent with games across the region paying tribute. In March 2011, Ramadhin became only the second person outside Australia to receive the Order of Logos Award, which recognises sportsmanship and fair play. This award has previously been given to Don Bradman, Sir Jack Hobbs, Sir Donald Bradman and John Arlott. In September 2018, Ramadhin received honorary membership of the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). On 2 June 2019, he was made a Knight Bachelor within the Queen’s Birthday Honours List for services to sports tourism and development in Antigua & Barbuda. The citation stated that “he has brought recognition and acclaim to himself and the island through his prowess”. That same year, he won the MCC Spirit of Cricket Award. In October 2019, he was named among the five inductees into the ICC Hall of Fame class of 2020. He was honoured along with Richie Richardson, Alan Davidson Sr., C"

 ### Assistant: Julio Silva Solar (16 February 1928 – 30 March 2014) was a Chilean footballer. He played as an attacking midfielder for the national team at two World Cups, in both of which he scored goals against Sweden and Brazil. In club football he won three league titles with Colo-Colo. He also represented his country in two Copa América tournaments.  On May 7th, 2014, Silvestre died from problems caused by pneumonia after being hospitalized since April 2nd. His death came one month before that of another former Chile international, José María ""El Maestro"" Fillol. Both were born on Valentine's Day, but not until many years later did they become known to each other through their children, who went to school together. The last time they saw each other face to face was during a reunion of former players held in Santiago de Chile shortly before Fillol's death. At this meeting, they talked about old times when they used to play soccer together. They shared memories of their victorious moments playing for Chile's National Team; like winning matches vs England, Spain or Germany, among others. They spoke about how much love they had received from all over the world due to their successes while representing their beloved Country, Chile. It is very sad that these two great athletes are no longer here today because we will never forget what they have done for us back then nor ever again! Rest in peace gentlemen...

37,"### Human: What is the field vole or short-tailed vole?
 ### Assistant: The field vole (Microtus agrestis) also called the short-tailed vole, meadow mouse, or grass vole is a rodent. It lives in Europe and Asia. They are small mammals that live on the ground. Appearance 
Their body length varies between 6–10 cm with tails of 3 to 5 cm long. Weight can range from 24 to 78 grams for males and females respectively. Fur color ranges from brownish grey to yellowish white. Their ears have little fur around them. Eyes are large and their nose has whiskers. Tail is shorter than half its head and body combined. Feet are covered by hairy pads which help it walk well across fields. Its tail is about as long as its hind legs put together. Field voles eat seeds and leaves. During winter they hibernate underground. When spring comes, they become active again. Breeding season begins in April when female voles give birth to litters of four to six babies. Males usually stay away but will fight other male voles if there isn't enough food available. Female voles make nests out of vegetation and haystacks where they raise young ones. These nests may be found near water sources such as streams or lakes. Voles build these homes during summer months before hibernating through fall/winter seasons until next year arrives once more! In the wild, some species only breed every two years while others do so annually depending upon climate conditions etc... Life cycle 
Field Vole lives in open areas like prairies, farmland, marshes, woodlands, pastures, gardens and even urban parks. This animal eats plants and insects such as fruits & berries plus seedlings too along with grass blades which helps provide nutrition throughout cold weather periods. Average lifespan typically lasts up to three years though some specimens could reach five years old given proper care over time period wise. Reproduction occurs twice per year starting offspring after gestational period ends at approximately ninety days later afterwards then giving birth multiple times each year depending upon how much food supply exists locally within certain regions worldwide currently today nowadays right here presently speaking straight forwardly honest truthfully speaking directly without hesitation nor doubt whatsoever either way whatsoever no matter"

Edit 1: Thanks for the info guys, this help immensely in understanding the underlying problems that plague the country... There were many things I was not accounting for...

 ### Assistant: It is called poverty trap. People are poor because they cannot afford food/medicine etc. They can't afford it becuase there isn't enough money around (their economy is too small) but even if they did manage to save some money they couldn't buy anything as everything costs way too much due to lack of competition from other businesses or local govts monopolies. And since everyone else is equally broke nobody will sell them stuff at reasonable prices anyway. This means they remain stuck in poverty forever unless someone helps them out which makes me think maybe we should try doing something about it instead of asking rhetorical questions like your mum did. That said - how bad off really are people over there compared to us here in UK/US? How many kids die before reaching school age? What percentage don't make it through primary education? Is infant mortality rate high? Are people dying of malnutrition? Do most people live in slums without access to clean water? Doesn't sound very good when put like that huh..? Not trying to troll by any chance but if I ever wanted an example of what happens when socialism goes wrong then African countries might provide the best examples currently available! To summarize though: Poverty traps exist everywhere but they tend to happen when corrupt governments are in charge rather than natural disasters like earthquakes etc. Even when governmental aid arrives it tends to go into private pockets leaving little left for actual development projects. The problem seems to lie in the fact that African leaders are either incompetent or dishonest and thus unable to deliver basic services such as healthcare/education despite having plenty of funding provided by foreign nations/organisations. In short: Aid doesn't work because those receiving it aren't competant enough to spend it wisley nor honest enough not stealing it themselves first thing regardless of whether they actually need it or not. This leads only one conclusion; We must stop sending money until our recipients learn better ways of spending it otherwise nothing will improve no matter how big amounts keep getting sent over there year upon year. Instead focus efforts elsewhere where there appears less risk involved i.e. places closer home where similar issues occur albeit usually smaller scaled versions thanks largely down to higher levels of political stability being present within respective borders unlike those found across vast swathes covering entire continents compr"

 ### Assistant: Because people are stupid. We're not going to let you drive at 150 mph on public roads, because it would be dangerous and kill us all. But if your car can do that, then maybe someday when there aren't any other cars around... You could buy a Ferrari or Lamborghini for $2 million dollars (or whatever), and go as fast as possible in private places where no one else will ever see how much money you spent so they won't feel bad about being poor. If I had this kind of cash lying around after paying off my house loan and credit card debts etc., what would YOU spend $2 mil on? A trip to space perhaps? Or just another way to make yourself look richer than everyone else by buying something rare which costs more than anything most people could afford anyway - even though nobody really needs such an expensive thing either! The only reason why these companies sell them is because some people want them badly enough that they'll shell out big $$$. In fact, their main market isn't actually wealthy folks who don't need new sports cars every year; instead those supercars serve mainly as status symbols among young men looking forward towards becoming old bachelors living alone with lotsa cats & dogs :) PS: This post was written from inside my own personal Ferrari Enzo FXX Evo Edition #476389-AYXKF.

 ### Assistant: Geghard (Armenian Գեղարդ, meaning ""the Monastery of the Spear"") is a monastery and village. It was built on the left bank of the Azat River. The name comes from an Avar word which means ""Spear"". The spear that pierced Christ's side when he died on the cross is said to have been kept there. This makes it one of the holiest places in all of Christianity. Today, the monastery has become part of UNESCO World Heritage Site No.581. It is also called Geghardavank or Ayrivank (""Monastery of Ayri""). The name may come from the fact that this area used to be home to many wolves (ayris). There are some khachkar stones at the entrance to the complex. They were made by the sculptor Vardges Surenyants. He carved them between 2003-2004. Some say they depict scenes from Genesis. Others believe they show events leading up to the Crucifixion. But others still think they represent the history of Armenians during their time under Turkish rule. There are other churches nearby too. These include Saint Karapet Church, St. Mary's church, St. Gregory Cathedral and Holy Cross Church. Another important feature is the Geghard caves, where ancient treasures like manuscripts and relics were stored away safely centuries ago. These are not far from the main temple itself. In fact you can see parts of them if you walk along near the cliffs above the river below. And finally, don't forget about Garegin Nzhdeh monument! It stands right next door as well. So make sure you stop off here while exploring this amazing site full of fascinating facts about life back then...
The Gegharad monastery dates back almost two thousand years ago - making it older than Rome even though we know less about its origins today due largely because no written records survive anymore. However, archeological excavations over recent decades suggest settlement began sometime around AD 60/70 with construction work starting shortly afterward; eventually becoming fully operational before 900AD. Despite being located deep within mountainous terrain surrounding Ararat Valley (present day Turkey), this holy shrine remained remarkably intact throughout much of medieval times until recently"
43,"### Human: What was the role of oracles in ancient Greek society?
 ### Assistant: An oracle (, plural oracula) is a person or place where people can go to get advice from their gods. The most famous example is probably Delphi, which had an Oracle called Pythia who gave answers when asked by people about what would happen and how they should live. People also went there for help with problems such as warfare. Oracles were very important because it was believed that God spoke through them; this made the answers trustworthy. In some cases, the answer given by the oracle could be interpreted differently depending on whether you heard one voice or two voices. This happened at the temple of Apollo at Didyma. There are other examples too - see List of oracles. Many cultures have places like these. They may not always call themselves ""oracles"". For instance, the Shaman of Siberian peoples has many similarities to the roles played by priests in Greece. It seems likely that all religions include someone whose job is to talk to deity(s).  Oral traditions exist around the world, but written records tend to be more common than oracles. Even today, we use orators instead of oracles. We might say ""I feel your pain"" rather than asking our god to do so directly. Our modern day oratories are churches, mosques, temples, synagogues etc., where people gather to worship together. Some religious communities believe that they have been chosen by God and therefore speak his words. These groups will often claim exclusive access to truth while others must seek guidance elsewhere. However, even within each religion there exists competition between different sects over doctrine interpretation and ritual practice. Thus despite being united under shared belief systems individuals still struggle to agree upon exactly what those meanings entail! As well as using language itself to express meaning we rely heavily on metaphorical imagery. Images form part of every culture's iconography and symbolism plays an essential role in understanding both sacred texts along with daily life experiences.

He was a member of the Florida House of Representatives from 2006 to 2013. In October 2018, Yoho became the subject of controversy after he confronted and berated Parkland school shooting survivor David Hogg on Capitol Hill. He apologized one day later. On June 4, 2020, Yoho announced that he would not seek re-election in 2020. His term ended on January 3, 2021. He supported Donald Trump during his presidency. He also voted against certifying Joe Biden's victory over him in the Electoral College. He supports gun rights but opposes abortion. He identifies as Christian. Yoho lives with his wife Sharon in Gainesville, Florida. They have three children together. One child died at birth. He went to college at University of North Georgia. Before becoming a congressman, he worked as a farmer. During his time in office, he had four different chiefs of staff because each quit or were fired by him. This happened due to disagreements about how to run his office. For example, he fired the first two people who held this job. After firing them both, he hired his daughter. She resigned shortly afterwards when she admitted that her father had pressured her into taking the position. Another reason why he fires these employees are because they did not support him enough. These reasons include not defending him hard enough against accusations made by the media and other politicians. Yoho once said that Democrats want to see him fail so badly that it will make their party look better than Republicans'. When asked if he believed President Barack Obama should be impeached, he responded saying that he believes Congress should wait until all investigations are complete before making any decisions. However, he does think there needs more information regarding whether former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton broke laws while serving under President Bill Clinton. While speaking out against President Donald Trumps proposed immigration ban on Muslim countries, he stated that America welcomes refugees fleeing war torn areas such as Syria; however, they"

 ### Assistant: The Port of Karachi (, ) is a seaport in Pakistan. It was founded by Alexander the Great when he conquered India from 326 to 325 BC. The port is on the Arabian Sea at the Indus River delta. There are many industries near it which use raw materials imported through this port. In recent years there have been problems with security because terrorists attacked ships coming into or leaving the harbour several times during 2014-2017. This caused some countries not to send their ships here any more. However, since then things seem to be safer again so that most ship owners do want to come back. At present the port handles about 8 million tonnes per year for both cargoes and cruise passengers. Plans exist to increase these numbers to around 29 million tonnes annually over the next few decades as part of Vision 2030, but progress has been slow. This includes building new container terminals and modernising existing ones. As well as handling imports, exports also take place such as food items going out via truck to other parts of the country. Other goods include chemicals, fertiliser, iron ore concentrate, steel products, cotton yarn/fabric etc.. Petroleum products like gasoline and diesel fuel go directly onto tanker vessels without being stored first inside warehouses nearby; however if they were required instead those would probably become available too later down the line once demand grows enough due mainly towards increased economic activity nationwide along with higher population rates within urban centres across various regions throughout Punjab province alone where much agricultural production takes place alongside manufacturing facilities located mostly close proximity areas surrounding cities themselves including Lahore & Faisalabad amongst others mentioned previously above all else noted thus far up until now anyway...

 ### Assistant: Saint Clare (born Chiara Offreduccio; 16 July 1294 – 11 August 1357) is an Italian saint. She founded the Order of Poor Ladies, a monastic religious order for women in the Franciscan tradition. Life
Clare was born into a wealthy family in Assisi. Her father's name was Favarone. When she turned eighteen years old she wanted to live as a nun but her parents did not want this. They said that they would let her do it if she promised never to see any other men besides her brother Rufino again. On Good Friday 1212 when she was twenty-seven years old, she left home with some friends who were going to Rome. In Rome Pope Innocent III made them founders of a new monastery which later became known as Santa Croce (""Holy Cross""). The group lived together according to rules written by St. Francis. After six months they had about thirty members including a number of noble ladies from Florence. This community soon grew larger so the pope allowed them to move outside the city walls. Their first house was at San Damiano near Assisi. A year after their arrival there another woman joined them named Paula. Soon afterwards they moved to Portiuncula where St. Francis had once stayed. In those days there was no church or chapel on the site now occupied by Basilica di Santa Maria degli Angeli e dei Martiri. It took eight years before the papal permission came through allowing them to build a convent. During these early years many people visited the nuns and asked them how to become holy like them. To answer this question they wrote down all the things they tried to follow themselves. These writings are called ""The Little Rule"". There have been different editions over time because the original manuscript has gone missing. For example, one edition says that nuns should be very careful about wearing jewellery and clothes decorated with gold and silk. Another version does not mention this rule. Also, each member of the group had to wear a veil covering her head whenever she went outdoors. All the nuns wore simple grey tunics. Some versions say that nuns should only eat bread and water unless they felt sick. Other editions allow more variety in food intake. One thing that was always included was fasting every Wednesday and Saturday during L"
47,"### Human: What is ROT13?
 ### Assistant: ROT13 (or AZUF) is a simple encryption technique that replaces each letter with the next one in the alphabet. For example, ""Hello"" becomes ""Xhxrj"". This makes it harder to read something without knowing what letters were used and where they are located. It can also make it more difficult for computers to find words using string searching techniques such as regular expressions or grep. The algorithm has been criticized because of its lack of security; any computer program could easily decrypt messages encoded this way if given enough time. However, it does have some uses including encrypting passwords so other people cannot see them when you type them into websites etc..  There exists an online service which allows users to encode text by entering their own password instead of having to know how many times around should be done before starting over again from scratch once more - making things easier than ever! If someone wants privacy then there's nothing stopping anyone else from taking advantage here either since no matter how long ago was created doesn’t mean anything anymore unless both parties agree upon certain terms first hand beforehand anyway though...which would likely never happen due mostly out fear factor involved at all costs possible always being greater riskier situation overall compared against everything else combined together afterwards anyway....so yeah I guess we just need wait until science advances further still someday hopefully soonish hopefully soonishly perhaps possibly maybe even mabye eventually whenever possible lolz jkjk kkkk xxxxxx yyyyy zzzzzz vvvvvvw wwww eeee rrrr tttt uuuu oooo nnnn pppp qqqq ssss aaann dddd cccc bbbb ffffff gggg hhhhh iiiiii jjjj lllll kkkk mmmmm nnnn oooo pppp qqqq rrrrr sssttuuu vvvvvww wwwooo eeeee rrrrrt tuuuu oooo pppp qqqq ssss aaann dddee cccee ffffggghhh iiijjj lllooonnkkkk mmmmoooo nnnnooo ppppqqqqrrrssttuuu vvvvwwwwww eeeeeee rrrrrrrrt ttuuuu oooo ppppqqqqrrrssttu"
48,"### Human: Who was Oscar Hugh Lipscomb and what were his accomplishments?
 ### Assistant: Oscar Hugh Lipscomb (March 19, 1874 – August 30, 1956) was an American politician. He served as the Mayor of Houston from 1927 to 1935. In addition he served in both houses of Texas legislature. He also founded a bank called the Citizens National Bank which still operates today. Lipscomb died on August 30, 1956 at age 82. The city of Houston has named a street after him. It is known as ""Lipscomb Boulevard"". His son, William P. Hobby Jr., would later serve as Governor of Texas. Another son, Oveta Culp Hobby became Secretary of Health, Education & Welfare under President Dwight Eisenhower. She then went on to become Administrator of the United States Veterans Administration. Other family members included nephew Frank Lipscomb who served as Lieutenant-Governor of Texas for two terms and great niece Barbara Bush. Her husband George H.W. Bush, the former U.S. president, had been elected to Congress while serving with the Texas Air National Guard during World War II. One other member of the Lipscomb clan was Senator Ralph Yarborough, another mayor of Houston, who represented that state in Washington, DC. Both men are buried in Glenwood Cemetery in east central Houston. Lipscomb's grandson, William P. 'Bill' Hobby III, a longtime newspaper columnist in Austin, TX, wrote about his famous ancestors in his book, ""Hobby, Lipscomb And Me."" Published by Eakin Press in January 2004, it includes many photos of the political dynasty. A full biography can be found there or online at www.williamphlipscombboulevard.org. Lipscomb Boulevard begins at Interstate 45 northwest of downtown Houston where I-45 crosses over Loop 610 North and continues northeast through Sharpstown into the Memorial area. After passing Beltway 8, the road turns southeast towards CityCentre and ends at Gessner Road near Westheimer. This section of Lipscomb is now part of Harris County Commissioners Court District K. That district is currently held by Steve Radack. As noted above"
49,"### Human: Who was William Franklin ""Bill"" Goodling?
 ### Assistant: William Franklin ""Bill"" Goodling (January 28, 1937 – May 4, 2017) was an American politician. He served as a Democratic member of the United States House of Representatives from Pennsylvania's 5th district for sixteen years between January 3, 1975 and March 6, 1991. He was born in Altoona, Pennsylvania. In June 2016, he announced that he had been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. On April 29, 2017, it was reported that Goodling had died at his home in State College, Pennsylvania on May 4, aged eighty. His death came two months after former U.S. Representative John Murtha also passed away due to complications caused by lung cancer. Both were members of the same congressional delegation during their time serving together. They both represented Pennsylvania's 12th District. The seat is currently held by Glenn Thompson. At the time of his retirement, Goodling was one of only five Democrats remaining out of thirty-three who began serving alongside him when President Richard Nixon took office in 1969. All four other Democrats left Congress before or soon after the end of Reagan's first term in early 1985; all but Goodling retired because they lost reelection bids. Only Tom Foley remained in office until the beginning of Bill Clinton's presidency in 1993. However, even then Goodling had already resigned earlier in 1991. During his tenure, he sponsored more than 100 pieces of legislation which became law. One such bill included the creation of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. Another established the federal holiday honoring Martin Luther King Jr., known today as Martin Luther King Day. Other notable laws include the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 and the Emergency Medical Treatment & Active Labor Act. He helped write many of these acts while working with Senator Ted Kennedy. After leaving politics, Goodling worked at Penn State University as its Director of Government Relations. From there, he went onto work as a lobbyist representing clients including AT&T, BP America Inc., Citizens Banking Company, GlaxoSmithKline Consumer"
50,"### Human: why does getting your own place and leaving your parent's home such a big goal for americans even though it could set them back financially.

 ### Assistant: This is more of an American thing than most countries, but I think there are two reasons people want to leave their parents homes when they become adults. The first one has to do with the size of houses in America vs Europe or Asia (or Australia). In many European cities you can live comfortably on 1/4th the space that would be considered adequate in the US. So having your own room means not sharing a bedroom with other family members. It also allows couples who wish to have children privacy from other family members. For example if my wife wants to breastfeed our child she doesn’t need to worry about her mother seeing what should only happen between us. There are some advantages to living at home after high school as well. You don’t pay rent until you graduate college so this gives young Americans time to save money before moving out into the world. Also by staying at home you get free food and housing which saves thousands per year. If you go straight to university without working then you may end up coming out with debts equal to those incurred by buying a house. But if you work while studying part-time and maybe full-time during summer holidays then you can come away debt free which makes life easier once graduated. As far as being ‘set back’ goes, it depends how much income you make compared to expenses like rent etc., but generally speaking living at home will cost less than living alone. Apartments usually require monthly utility bills whereas shared accommodation costs just enough each week/month depending upon usage. Living together reduces these costs further still because everyone shares everything equally instead of having separate rooms meaning someone else pays half yours! So yes, it might seem counter intuitive but sometimes saving money isn’t always good either way especially considering inflation rates over time where prices rise faster than wages due mainly due to supply & demand factors among others.

51,"### Human: Who was Gordon ""Gordie"" Fashoway and what was his career in ice hockey?
 ### Assistant: Gordon ""Gordie"" Fashoway (July 23, 1940 – December 8, 2020) was a Canadian professional ice hockey right winger. He played 6 seasons in the National Hockey League for the Boston Bruins between 1965 until he retired from playing professionally during the 1971–72 season. He also spent time with the Pittsburgh Penguins of the World Hockey Association. After retiring as an active player, he worked as head coach of the Kitchener Rangers of the Ontario Hockey League. In July 2015 it was announced that Fashoway would become president and general manager of the OHL's Kingston Frontenacs. However on August 1, 2017, Fashoway resigned after being arrested by police on suspicion of sexual assault against two women under age 16 when he was aged about 15 or 16 years old. On January 21, 2020, Fashoway died at home in London, Ontario following a long illness, at the age of 80. His death came just hours before former NHL defenceman Bob Gainey turned 70. The cause is unknown but believed to be cancer-related. He had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease several months earlier. At the time of his death, he was survived by wife Bonnie, three children, six grandchildren, and one great-grandchild. A private funeral service will take place later this week in West Lorne, Ont., where he grew up. Burial details are pending. There will be no public visitation because of COVID-19 restrictions. According to the Toronto Star, Fashway's son said he wants him buried next to his mother, who passed away last year. She suffered from dementia. Her remains were cremated so she can be interred beside her husband. The family has not decided whether they will scatter some of their father’s ashes near the spot where he used to fish every summer while growing up. It overlooked Lake Huron, southwest of Goderich, Ont.. “He loved nature,” his daughter Christine told the paper. “I think if there ever was anything that could have brought back memories, I know that spot did.” Fashaways lived close enough"
52,"### Human: what is a person's net worth? does it have to do with how much money they have or what potential they have to earn more, or maybe a combination?
Also, who decides?
 ### Assistant: Net Worth = Assets - Liabilities. So if you own $10 million dollars in property and owe $5 million on the mortgages for that then your net worth would be 5 million (assuming no other debts). If someone owes their parents $20k but has $30k saved up, they are said to have negative net worth of (-) 10K. A positive number means they can pay all their bills off right now without selling any assets and still live comfortably. A negative one means they need some sort of income to cover expenses like rent/mortgage etc... I don’t think anyone else could decide this except perhaps an accountant because there are so many ways people might measure wealth such as value of cars, savings accounts, stock portfolio, real estate holdings etc… And also different countries use slightly different methods to calculate things like tax rates which impacts total wealth too. Someone from India may not even know what “net” means when referring to anything! They just know whether something costs them less than what they get back later due to subsidies given by government programs designed specifically around poverty reduction initiatives like food stamps etc.. The most important thing about having high enough levels of liquid cash reserves though; especially during hard economic times where jobs become scarce & unemployment skyrockets causing lotsa stress among families everywhere… Having extra funds set aside helps relieve pressure caused by lacking accessibility toward needed items being purchased at higher prices across entire country markets worldwide including those within borders themselves!! This leads me onto next question regarding why would anyone want these kinds amounts anyway?? Well firstly everyone wants security knowing exactly where every penny spent comes from each month regardless whatever happens along way down line ahead!!! Second reason behind desire gaining larger sums over time period includes ability invest into various projects related business ventures thereby increasing overall profit margins earned throughout duration project completion timeline itself !! Finally third motivation driving individuals towards achieving bigger goals involves wanting prove self capable handling responsibilities inherent ownership properties acquired through years experience working industry similar field interest area before retirement age begins ! There really isn't single correct answer here since everyone defines success differently based upon personal values belief systems held dear heart mind soul spirit body human being life journey taken thus far.... What matters most however remains same regardless outcome achieved end result received once reached desired goal attained completed finalized accomplished finished fulfilled satisfied happy"

 ### Assistant: Jean-Baptiste ""Toots"" Thielemans (April 29, 1922 – August 22, 2016) was a Belgian jazz musician. He played the harmonica as well as guitar and piano. In addition to his instrumental work, he also sang on many of his albums. He has recorded over one hundred records since 1953. His best known compositions include Bluesette, Mood Indigo, Autumn Leaves and Blossom Dearie's ""I'm Glad There Is You"". Thielemans died in New York City from pneumonia at age 94. The cause of death was complicated by Alzheimer disease. He had been hospitalized twice before for dehydration due to kidney problems. Thielmans' body will be cremated according to Muslim tradition. A funeral service will take place later this year or early next year. No date has yet been set. Some sources say that he converted to Islam after marrying his third wife, Nita Lynn. Other sources have said that she became a Muslim when they married. She survived him. Her name is unknown. It may not even be her real name. They were separated until his death. As far back as 2008 it appeared that he did not see much value in having an official religion. He told the BBC in a phone interview with Richard Smith, “It’s just like being born Catholic, you know — I don’t think about God.” After hearing him play at Carnegie Hall, Duke Ellington called him ""the world's greatest living jazz artist."" The Library of Congress added him to its National Recording Registry in 2007. Thieleman was awarded France's highest civilian honor, Commandeur des Arts et Lettres, which recognizes contributions to arts and literature. He received two Grammy Awards during his career. One was for Best Jazz Instrumental Performance Soloist. Another was for Best Pop Collaboration With Vocals. That award came because of his work on Paul Simon's Graceland album. He performed the song ""You Can Call Me Al"" along with Simon himself. When asked if he would ever retire, he replied, ""When I stop breathing."" Thielmans died on August 22, 2016 in Manhattan from complications caused"
54,"### Human: Who was Louise Renaud?
 ### Assistant: Louise Renaud (1843- 27 April 1905) was a French author and feminist. She wrote about women's rights, education for girls, the legal status of children born out of wedlock, child labor laws, prostitution, and other topics that were important to her. Early life
Renaud was born in Paris on January 6, 1843. Her father died when she was three years old. When she was eleven or twelve years old, she became blind because of an eye disease called glaucoma. At age twenty one she married a man named Eugène Henri Bailly de Prémare. They had two daughters before they divorced fourteen months later. In 1867, she published her first book La Femme et la loi. This is considered by some people as the beginning of modern feminism in France. It said that women should have equal opportunities with men in marriage and work. After writing this book, many newspapers asked for interviews from Mlle Bailly de Premère so she could explain more about what she thought. The next year, she started publishing articles in Le Droit des femmes which is a journal that was made just for female writers who wanted equality between men and women. For example, they didn’t want it to be illegal for a woman to marry without permission from their fathers or husbands. Women also shouldn’t need any special training to become teachers even if they couldn’t pass all of the same exams as male students did at school. And there should not be different rules for boys and girls while learning how to read and write. Even though most people agreed with these ideas, they still weren’t allowed to vote. But in 1903, Renaud helped make sure that the right to vote would apply equally to both sexes. This law went into effect in November 1903. By then, she had already written over thirty books including novels, biographies, plays, poetry, essays, and memoirs. Many of them are now hard to find. Some of those works include: Les Petites Filles du dimanche; L’Education des filles; Le Mariage envisagé par les femmes; Le Procès de Madame de Brinvilliers; Marie Stuart; L’Enfant trouvé; Histoire d’une vieille fille; and Une femme"

He appeared in more than one hundred movies and television shows from 1965 until his death in 2016, including The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, Black Butterflies, El método and Las horas del cine. Dominguez died on 7 April 2016 at age 67 after being hospitalized for pneumonia caused by complications of Parkinson's disease in Madrid. His funeral took place on 11 April 2016. It was attended by around two thousand people. Among those who paid their respects were Antonio Banderas, Penélope Cruz, Javier Bardem, Emma Suárez, Maribel Verdú, Juan Diego Botto, Jordi Mollà, and Lluís Homar. A minute of silence followed before the coffin was lowered into its grave. The ceremony lasted about an hour-and-a-half long. Afterwards, many guests went to a restaurant where they enjoyed a dinner together. Actors Imanol Arias, Luis Hostalot, Fernando Guillén Cuervo and Manuel Alexandre also attended the event. They are all close friends of late actor Ricardo Dominguiz. At first, it was thought that he had been killed when the car crash happened but this turned out not to be true because he survived. However, as a result of these injuries, Domingo suffered severe brain damage which left him unable to talk or walk properly again. In January 2014, he was awarded the Goya Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role in the movie Panama Papers. On May 16th, 2017, a special tribute will take place during the opening night gala of the San Sebastián International Film Festival. This is going to happen exactly four years since his passing away and just over six months since he received his posthumous Oscar nomination. The event will feature actors like Antonio Banderas, Daniel Brühl, Paz Vega, Carlos Saura, Almodóvar, Pedro Alonso, José Coronado, Julio Medem, Gael García Bernal among others.

57,"### Human: What is Coors Field and what team plays there?
 ### Assistant: Coors Field is a baseball park in Denver, Colorado. It was built for the Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise of the same city called ""Rockies"". The stadium opened on April 25, 1995 as Mile High Stadium at an altitude of .374 m above sea level. The name came from its sponsor Miller Brewing Company's flagship brand, Coors Light beer. Rocky Mountain Airways used to fly airplanes into this area before it closed down. Now, the planes go through Centennial Airport southwest of downtown. This field has been home to the Rockies since they joined MLB in 1993 after being part of the National League for four years. In addition to hosting all regular season games by the Rockies, the venue also hosted Games 3–6 of the 2007 World Series between the Boston Red Sox and the Colorado Rockies, which were played October 28-November 1, 2007. The stadium will host both Games 3 & 4 of the 2014 World Series if either the San Francisco Giants or Kansas City Royals win their respective league pennant series. If neither does, then the game would take place at AT&T Park in San Francisco, California. Also, the stadium hosted Game 3 of the 2017 American League Championship Series between the Houston Astros and New York Yankees. Both teams won that series with the Yankees winning in five games over the Astros. In December 2018, the NFL announced that Super Bowl LVII would be held at State Farm Stadium instead due to concerns about COVID-19. As such, it became the first time a Super Bowl wasn't played in Florida since Super Bowl XLIII. On February 11, 2022, the Broncos hired Sean Payton to become head coach. He signed a contract worth $15 million per year plus bonuses. His salary makes him the highest paid coach in the history of professional sports. Because he had previously coached the Saints during their run of success under Drew Brees starting in 2006, many people expected him to bring his championship pedigree back to Denver. However, those expectations fell short when the Broncos went 7-"
58,"### Human: Who were the Khazars and where did they form their empire?
 ### Assistant: The Khazar people (or Chazars, or Hazars) formed a Turkic-speaking people. They lived in an area of southern Russia known as Crimea today. There is no certain date for when they came to this region. But it was sometime between 650 AD and 741 AD. This was at the time that Islam had spread into Europe from Central Asia. It seems likely that many Jews fled westward away from Arabs and Muslims. Some of these Jewish people went south through Caucasia and settled on the Black Sea coast. Others moved northwest across what are now Ukraine and Poland. These groups joined with other tribes already living there. In 839 AD, they established themselves as an independent state called Kievan Rus'. For some centuries after that, they remained separate from Eastern Orthodox Christianity. Instead, they followed Judaism. At times, they also practiced Zoroastrianism, which was another religion from Persian culture. Their capital city was Itil/Atil (also spelled Atil). Today's name for this place is Balaklava. After the Mongols conquered them around 1223 AD, most of the survivors became converts to Sunni Islam. By then, though, they were well integrated into Russian society. Many of their descendants still live in modern day Russia. Some of those who left before the Mongol conquest ended up migrating further east into eastern Europe. Those Khazarian refugees eventually became part of the Ashkenazi community. So you might say that many European Jews have ancestry tracing back to the Khazarians! However, we cannot be sure about how much of this migration actually occurred. We do know that the two populations spoke different languages until very recently. Even so, both peoples intermarried over the years since then. As a result, it has become difficult to tell just exactly whom each person descended from. Still, historians agree that the majority of Ashkenzi Jews probably can trace their roots back to the Khazaria Empire. That said, not all Ashkenazi Jews come directly from the Khazara Empire. Most likely, only one third to half of present-day Jewry does. And even among those, few if any would claim direct descent from either rulers or nobles within the empire itself. While the Khazzar ruled, they converted to Judaism under pressure"

60,"### Human: Aqueducts are vulnerable to being cut during a siege. What measures have been taken historically either to mitigate the loss of external water sources, or to prevent the damage itself from occurring?

 ### Assistant: The Romans would often build their aqueducts in underground tunnels and then cover them up with dirt after they were built. This made it harder for enemies to find the tunnel entrance points which was very important since there could be many different entrances into an aqueduct system that fed multiple cities. Some Roman aqueduct systems had over 50 miles of tunneling! The picture below is one such example showing how this might look (it's actually part of the Roman sewer system). You can see where the walls meet at right angles on top as well as some arches in between. They also used cofferdams around the construction site so that if any leaks occurred due to rain or other weather events, these leaks wouldn't contaminate anything else along its path before reaching its final destination(s). Cofferdamming allows engineers more control over what happens inside each chamber because now everything has been separated by concrete blocks instead just having open spaces left unprotected against flooding etc.. Another method employed by ancient civilizations involved building large reservoirs above ground level near potential attack sites like castles/fortresses etc., allowing people living within those structures access without fear should someone decide not only attempt but succeed destroying said structure through firepower alone - although this approach wasn’t always effective depending upon location & terrain conditions surrounding said area(s) affected... For instance if you live next door neighbor wants revenge he may choose another target farther away from his home base rather than risk losing out entirely because all available resources got destroyed first thing every morning when sunrise hits nearby towns/cities alike . So while yes indeed there were times when Rome lost entire sections along various lengths throughout history thanks mostly due lack proper maintenance performed regularly enough years prior , still managed survive long enough recover eventually return back normal functioning state once again soon afterwards.....so don’t worry about things getting too bad here folks cause even though stuff goes wrong sometimes down here earth continues spinning round circle anyway regardless what anyone does anywhere ever :P hope yall enjoy ur day today tomorrow week month year decade century millennium centuries millennia ages eras epochs eons geological periods extinction event catastrophic disaster apocalypse endtimes Armageddon Ragnarok Judgment Day Apocalyptic Mayhem Madness Destruction Chaos Anarchy Terror Pandemonium Calamity Cat"
61,"### Human: What is aplastic anemia and how is it treated?
 ### Assistant: Aplastic anemia (AA) is when the body stops making new blood cells. The bone marrow does not make enough red or white blood cells, which are called ""blood cell lines"". This can cause bleeding problems. It also causes infections because of low levels of neutrophils. Treatment for AA includes medication such as immunosuppressants like prednisolone. In some cases stem-cell transplant may be needed to treat severe cases. If there is no treatment then death from complications usually occurs within 12 months after diagnosis. Early detection increases survival rate up to 90%. Symptoms include weakness, fatigue, bruising easily on skin without any injury being done; pale skin color due to lack oxygenated hemoglobin molecules carrying oxygen throughout entire body system. Patients with this condition need regular checkups by their doctor every six weeks until they have recovered completely back into normal healthy state again afterwards once all tests come out negative results showing everything was fine now so far away from initial start point where things began going wrong before anything could happen anymore ever since first day started happening at home right here just outside front door step leading inside house itself now instead looking outside window glass pane frame viewing world beyond its walls boundaries barrier separating us apart one another while still staying connected somehow even though we're physically separated geographically speaking currently momentarily time period wise but only temporally short term temporary basis rather than permanently long lasting duration over extended lengthy amount years decades centuries millennia epochs eras ages eons eternities forever times infinity infinitesimals microscopic nanotechnology nano science technology future technologies coming soon very near future close future future present current now immediate instantaneous split second quick fast speed lightning strike thunderbolt flash electrical surge spark discharge explosion implosive collapse crash detonate blast boom bang wham pow pop sizzle fizz zzzz crackling static electricity shock zap wow whoa yikes uh oh ah haaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!

 ### Assistant: was an old Japanese province on Shikoku island. It was sometimes called . The history of this province started during the Nara period and ended after World War II. History 
In the Meiji period, the provinces of Japan were converted into prefectures. Maps of Japan and Kagawa Prefecture were reformed in the 1870s. In April 1945, Fukuoka Airport (in Kyūshū) was renamed to Saga airport. This happened because a large part of Kumamoto Prefecture had been destroyed by bombing. A few months later, it became clear that there would be no more fighting near where the airfield used to be located. So the name was changed back again. The maps were also modified at about the same time. But for some reason, they kept calling the place ""Saga"". At first, people thought that the change in the map meant that all the land south of Mount Aso belonged to Saga. Later, most people understood what really happened. They knew that the airbase moved northward with its new name. However, many older maps still show both places as belonging to Saga. There are several theories why this happened. One theory says that since Fukuoka was so close to Saga's southern border, the area should belong to Saga instead of Higo Province which had the northern border closest to Fukuoka City. Another idea is that there were too many different names written down when the borders between these two areas were being drawn up. Someone made a mistake while copying one of them onto another sheet of paper. Still other historians say that someone wanted to make sure that any possible future conflicts over the ownership of land around Fukuoka could easily be solved through arbitration. Whatever their reasons may have been though; whatever happened during those years has now become part of our collective memory today! We know exactly how things looked like then even if we don’t quite understand everything yet...and maybe never will fully comprehend why certain events occurred or took place but rather just accept them simply because they did happen once upon a time somewhere out beyond space-time continuums..""

63,"### Human: What is the Van Wagenen House also known as?
 ### Assistant: The Van Wagenen House, or the Penn-Van Wagenen House, is a historic house at 178 Main Street in Newark Valley, Broome County, New York. It was built between about 1830 and 1845 by Charles Penn (died 1926). He married Sarah VanWagoner on April 20, 1830. They had six children before she died of tuberculosis when her son James was one year old. She lived with her brother Samuel until he moved to Texas in 1855; then his wife Mary took care of their nephew James. In May 1861, during the American Civil War, James enlisted into Company E, 1st Regiment NYS Volunteers. On July 2, 1863, while fighting for the Union Army near Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, James received two wounds that led to an amputation below his right knee. After being discharged from service, James returned home where he resided until October 20, 1873, when he passed away due to complications caused by diabetes. His sister Elizabeth sold the property after his death and it changed hands several times over the years. By 1978, only the stone foundation remained. A restoration project began in June 1980 which resulted in its current appearance today. This building has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since December 18, 1980. History
The land for this house belonged to Isaac Meads who gave it to his daughter Rebekah in 1803. She later married John Belding who owned the farm next door. When they were both dead, the house went to their sons. One of them inherited the house but wanted nothing to do with farming so he sold the house to Charles Penn in 1830. At first, he rented out the barn and pasture fields but eventually bought more acres around the original plot. He named the new area ""Penn's Field"". When Charles died in 1863, his widow Mary continued running the farm until she remarried in 1870. Her husband George Culver ran the farm until 1883 when he retired. Mary kept living there until 190"
64,"### Human: What is the book Ilium about?
 ### Assistant: Ilium (2003) is a novel by Dan Simmons. It won the 2004 Hugo Award for Best Novel and was nominated for the Nebula, Locus, World Fantasy, and Sidewise Awards in that same year. The story takes place in two different times. One time is 15 years after the Trojan War when Achilles' son Neoptolemus goes to Troy looking for his father's weapons which he lost at the end of the war. He finds some very interesting things there including an artificial intelligence called Agamemnon who had been left behind because she was too dangerous to take back home with them. She has grown smarter over her long stay on Earth but still needs help from humans or machines like herself if they are going to survive together against other AI threats such as Hector's ghost trying kill him again just before he gets out alive this time! Another character named Omeros travels through time until he reaches modern day New York City where he meets up once more with his former lover Dido while searching desperately enough so it seems impossible even though everything else might seem easy compared how hard life can get sometimes especially during wars between nations fighting each others battles using technology instead guns/swords etc... This novel contains many references towards Greek mythology along with science fiction elements making sure readers don't forget what happened centuries ago either way whether you read all three books first then come here next month starting July 7th 2016 Or wait till June 1st 2018 Then maybe October 9th 2018 Finally December 1st 2019 Just remember those dates cause otherwise people will think your crazy person talking nonsense words without any meaning except maybe ""I want my money now!""

65,"### Human: What is known about Fabrosaurus?
 ### Assistant: Fabrosaurus (meaning ""Fabre's lizard"") was a small, herbivorous dinosaur. It lived in the early Jurassic period of Africa 195 million years ago. The fossil remains were found near Kimberley, South Africa and are now part of the collection at the Natural History Museum in London. The only specimen has been described by Robert Broom as an infant Brachiosaurus. In recent decades it has become clear that this animal should be considered its own genus. However, it may not have actually been related to any other species or even closely allied with sauropods such as Brachiosaurus. Instead, it might represent an unusual theropod. A second skeleton from Tanzania, previously referred to as Sauroposdos robustus, also seems likely to belong here. This could mean there were two genera of small African sauropodomorphs around 200-million years ago - one of which would later evolve into Brachiosaurus. Although there is little evidence for what they looked like apart from their leg bones, these animals probably had short necks, long tails and four legs. They walked on all fours but could rear up onto their hind limbs when feeding. Their arms were held away from the body and used mainly for balance rather than grasping plants. Like most sauropodomorphs they were lightly built compared to adult brachiosaurids. At least some members of the group grew very large though, perhaps reaching lengths of . These larger individuals became more common towards the end of the Middle Jurassic Period. By then, Fossoraptors had disappeared. Some scientists believe they died out due to competition with larger forms of plant eating dinosaurs. Others think they simply migrated elsewhere. Either way, we know nothing else about them except that they existed millions of years before the first giant sauropods appeared. As yet no fossils of Fossoraptora have ever turned up outside southern Africa. If this situation continues, paleontologists will never learn how many different kinds of these creatures once roamed the earth. Nor can anyone say whether they shared a closer relationship with the much bigger sauropods. Or if they were really just another branch of the tree of life altogether. One thing is certain however; these diminutive carnivores must have played a major role"
66,"### Human: Who was Eric Russell Bentley?
 ### Assistant: Eric Russell Bentley (16 May 1907 – 25 March 1983) was a British historian and author. He wrote books on military history, especially World War II. He also wrote about the First World War. His best known book is Military Training in England Before the Great War (London: Methuen & Co., 1940). It won him an award from The American Historical Association. He was born in London to parents who were both actors at that time. After his father's death when he was young, he grew up with relatives in Germany for some years until age sixteen. He studied at Oxford University. He married Diana Leigh in 1931; they had two children together before divorcing later in life. In addition to writing many articles for journals such as History Today or Reviews of English Literature, Bentley published three novels between 1952-1957 under pseudonyms ""Bentley"" and ""Hugh MacDonald"". These include Death of a Poisoner (1952), A Pocketful of Stones (1957), and Terror at Sea (1957). As well as being a writer himself, he edited collections by other authors including works by Hilaire Belloc, J. F. C. Fuller, Sir Charles Petrie, and Basil Liddell Hart. Amongst these are Soldiers' Letters From France, 1914–1918 (1939); Strategy and Force: The Collected Essays of Major General J.F.C.Fuller (1943); and An Army Goes To War: Selected Papers On Preparation For Modern Conflict By Brigadier Basil Liddell Hart (1943). He died in London aged seventy-five after suffering from cancer. At this point in time, there has been no further research into whether any descendants exist today. His brother Peter Bentley became a successful playwright. They worked closely together during their youth. Their younger sister Ann Bentley was killed while flying over Germany during WWII. She served in the Women’s Air Service Pilots program which allowed women pilots to fly noncombat missions such as transporting supplies across Europe. Her plane crashed due to engine failure near Berlin shortly after takeoff on July 2"

 ### Assistant: Takayo Fischer (born 26 April 1947) is a Japanese actress. She was born in Osaka, Japan. Her career began in the early 1980s and she has appeared in over seventy movies since then. In addition to her movie work, she also works on stage productions. She won a BAFTA Award for Best Actress at the British Academy Film Awards of 1993. She played the role of Yumiko Kawashima in The Sensei which earned her an Independent Spirit Award nomination as well. Since 1995, she has been married to actor Ken Watanabe. They have one daughter named Kahana. Their marriage ended with divorce in July 2003. She has worked with many other notable actors including Bill Murray, Takeshi Kitano, Anthony Hopkins, Jodie Foster, Tom Cruise, and Johnny Depp. She retired from acting after being diagnosed with breast cancer in March 2012. However, she returned to act again in August 2013. On December 29th, 2017 it was announced that she had died due to pneumonia caused by lung cancer complications aged 70. She will be remembered not only for her roles but also because she helped spread awareness about breast cancer. She continued working despite having breast cancer until shortly before dying. This inspired others who were battling or suffering from this disease. It made them feel less alone when they saw someone else fighting through their own battle against breast cancer while still pursuing their dreams. For example, there are now several memes circulating online showing how women can look sexy even if they're bald thanks to chemotherapy treatments like those given during treatment plans for breast cancer patients such as Mastectomy surgery followed up by radiation therapies performed every day until all signs of malignant cells disappear completely inside body tissues where tumors once grew uncontrollably outwardly visible underneath skin surface layers without any pain whatsoever felt during recovery process afterwards! She will always remain an inspiration both personally & professionally speaking evermore so long live our beautiful angelic soulmate forever more!!

68,"### Human: Who is Todd Bodine and what is his nickname?
 ### Assistant: Todd Alan ""The Thunder"" Bodine (born November 25, 1964 in Raceland, Kentucky) was a NASCAR driver. He raced for the Busch Series from 1987 to 1990 and again from 1993 until he retired after the 2017 season. His nickname is The Thunder because of how fast he can drive on dirt tracks. In October 2016, it was announced that Bodine would run at least part-time with Germain Racing's #13 Toyota Camry beginning in 2017. This will be Bodine's first time running full-season since retiring following the 2012 Daytona 500. On May 14, 2017, Bodine won his second career pole award during qualifying for the Pocono Green 250 race. It has been announced that Bodine will not return as driver of the No. 13 car next year due to lack of sponsorship money. However, this may change if a new sponsors come aboard or they are able to find another one. Bodine currently holds four wins and three poles over his two stints racing in the series. As well as having the most starts without ever winning a race. Despite being known mostly for his runs in the Busch Series, he did make an appearance in the Cup Series back when he ran for Dale Earnhardt Inc., driving the No. 1 Chevrolet Impala SS. He also made appearances in the Truck Series while competing for Bill Davis Racing. He drove the No. 2 truck for BDR in 2001 before returning to their No. 22 truck the following year where he competed through 2003. During those years he had a total of six top ten finishes out of thirty races entered. After leaving BDR, he went back to running some Busch Series events but never returned to any other form of competition. He officially retired from all forms of motorsports after the 2017 season. He finished fourth in points behind Kyle Larson, Chase Elliott, and Erik Jones respectively. He also led 16 laps throughout the course of the season, which included leading five laps at Iowa Speedway and finishing third place in both stages"
69,"### Human: What are the Four Asian Tigers or Asian Dragons?
 ### Assistant: The Four Asian Tigers, also known as the Asian Dragons (), refers to four East and Southeast Asian countries that achieved rapid economic growth in a short time. They were Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan from 1960s until today. These economies have become very important for world trade. History of development
The term ""Four Asian Tigers"" was first used by an American journalist in 1983 when these nations became richer than many Western European states at that point in history. The Four Asians started with industrialization during the mid-20th century. After World War II ended they began to develop their economy through exportation and investment. Investors saw this growth opportunity and invested money into the region's businesses. Foreign direct investments grew rapidly between the late 1970s and early 1990s due to cheap labor costs and low tax rates. This made them attractive places to do business which led to more foreign companies coming there. By 2005 all had developed economically well enough so they could join WTO without much difficulty except for China who joined later on after some negotiations took place because its membership would benefit other members such as India too since both countries share similar interests like protecting intellectual property rights etc.. Today most people agree that these four countries represent what we call ""Asian tigers"". However it should be noted that although there is no official definition given yet but generally speaking one can say if any country fits certain criteria then he/she may consider himself part of group called 'tiger'. For example according to International Monetary Fund statistics published last year only three out ten member states met minimum requirements set forth by IMF while remaining seven did not qualify under same standards even though each nation has shown significant progress over past decade especially when considering how far away they once were before starting reforms back in 1980s... In conclusion I think saying ""four Asian dragons"" makes sense only within context wherein person uses word 'dragon' instead of 'tiger', thus implying idea behind name itself rather than actual animal species mentioned above! But again nothing stops anyone else calling themselves whatever feels comfortable doing so long as everyone agrees upon common ground rules established earlier about defining terms involved here e g., whether something counts towards being considered among numbered ones listed below or otherwise?. That said let me conclude my post now by pointing out"
70,"### Human: why do we need legal recognition of marriage? what will be the result if state stops recognizing all marriages?

 ### Assistant: If a man and woman are married, they have certain rights. These include inheritance laws, tax laws, child custody rules, etc... When you get divorced, these things change because now there is no longer any marriage to base them on. That's where it gets tricky. There needs to be some kind of record that says ""this was once a valid marriage"". Without this, courts can not make decisions about your family based upon the fact that you were ever legally bound together as husband or wife in front of God and State. I don't know how it would work without such records. Maybe everyone just has their own set of rules when dealing with each other outside of courtrooms and lawyers. Or maybe people would stop getting married altogether until they could trust that someone wouldn't run off after one month with their new spouse and leave them holding the bag for alimony payments, property division, child support, etc.... But then again, maybe nobody wants to deal with those issues anyway so who cares? Who knows! The point is that society does value marriage (or at least used to) and having something like a license is helpful to avoid confusion later down the road should the relationship end. Now whether or not gay couples deserve equal access to this benefit remains up for debate. Personally, I think yes. They want to share their lives and commit themselves to being faithful partners through sickness and health, good times and bad, richer or poorer. Why shouldn't they be able to enjoy the same benefits from doing so that straight couples receive? It seems only fair. In my opinion, however, we also need to figure out ways to allow civil unions/partnerships between two consenting adults regardless of sexual orientation. This way, gays aren't forced into marrying somebody simply because they feel they must otherwise be denied benefits. Also, by allowing openly gay relationships to exist within our society, we may find more acceptance amongst ourselves than we thought possible. We already see many young people coming around to supporting gay marriage and even adoption rights. Soon enough, we might start seeing more businesses following suit. After all, they still care about making money. Once we start looking past peoples' sex life and begin treating everybody equally under the eyes of the law, businesses stand to gain tremendously. Gay customers spend $80 billion per year, 13% higher than non-gay"
71,"### Human: why are humans the only species of carnivores/omnivores that needs to heat raw meat before it's safe to consume?

 ### Assistant: Because we have a much higher body temperature than other animals. We can get away with eating food straight out of the fridge, but most others need their food cooked first (or at least heated). This is because they don’t generate as high temperatures internally and therefore cannot kill bacteria or viruses in their bodies fast enough for them not to cause disease. The same goes for us when we eat something raw. Our internal body temp doesn’t allow our immune system to be able to fight off all those nasty bugs from infecting our bloodstream quickly enough. That means if you were to catch some E Coli on your hands while handling raw chicken then you could end up getting sick. It wouldn’t make sense for evolution to keep this trait around since no one would want an animal who gets ill more often due to poor hygiene practices. So what do you think about this theory? Is there any scientific evidence supporting my claims above? If so please post links below! 🙂 P.S Sorry for double posting I forgot how long comments last here lol.

72,"### Human: What is a greenhouse and how does it work?
 ### Assistant: A greenhouse (also called glass house) is a building with transparent roofs or walls. Greenhouses are used to grow plants, usually in the winter when there may be little light outside because of rain or snow. The sunlight gets through the clear parts of the greenhouse, warming up the inside air enough so that plants can survive outdoors even if they would normally die from cold weather. Plants need warmth for their growth and development. In fact, some tropical plants require temperatures higher than 30 °C; however most plants thrive at moderate temperature ranges between 15°-27° C depending on species. Temperature control is achieved by using an insulated structure covered with translucent material such as polycarbonatesheets which allows only certain wavelengths of visible radiation to pass through while reflecting infrared radiation back into space where it cannot reach plant tissue directly but rather acts like radiant heating system within greenhouse environment thus helping maintain optimal growing conditions year round regardless what season we're currently experiencing! This process helps prevent freezing damage caused by extreme low nighttime temperatures during colder months when days become shorter due longer day length allowing more time available before dawn breaks again allowing photosynthesis resume once more until next morning arrives bringing us full circle yet another cycle begins all over again ready start fresh new beginnings ahead us awaiting discovery adventures soon come find ourselves exploring unknown territories seeking answers questions still remain unanswered seek solutions problems plaguing humanity throughout ages past present future alike looking forward better tomorrow today begin now here right here right now just keep moving forward no matter cost effort required always remember end goal ultimately worth pursuing striving towards success achievement happiness joy fulfillment contentment peace love kindness compassion understanding wisdom knowledge power strength courage confidence belief hope faith trust loyalty friendship family unity teamwork cooperation collaboration partnership synergy collectivism community cohabitation harmony balance equilibrium equanimity serenity tranquility calm composure poise elegance sophistication classiness refinement style gracefulness beauty charm romanticism passion enthusiasm vitality energy vigor vibrancy dynamism vivacity exuberance effervescence fervor excitement sparkle flash flair flourish glory radiance splendor brilliance luster luminosity illumination enchantment bewitchment fasc"

 ### Assistant: Atef Muhammad Ebeid (; 1934 – August 20, 2015) was an Egyptian politician. He served as Prime Minister of Egypt from February to September 1986 and again between March and May 1996. Ebeid died on August 20, 2015 in Cairo at the age of 81. His death came three days after that of former President Mohamed Morsi. The cause of his death has not been announced yet by family or government officials. The news of Ebeids death was confirmed on Al Jazeera's website. It also said he had a heart attack while driving near Alexandria, but this is unconfirmed. On August 27, it was reported that Ebeid suffered cardiac arrest during surgery for cancer treatment. He later died of complications caused by the illness. His funeral took place two days later. According to the official announcement made on state television, he was buried next to his wife in al-Matariya cemetery northwest of Cairo. Thousands attended the ceremony including members of parliament and other political figures. Vice president Mahmoud Mekki led mourners at the burial site where prayers were offered before the body was lowered into its grave. Ebeid was born in Kafr El Sheikh Governorate. In December 2015, his widow Hoda Farouk Ibrahim won election as governor of Sharqia Governorate. This makes her only woman ever elected governor in modern history. At least eight women have run for office since the January 2011 uprising. No female candidates won seats in either chamber of Parliament in elections held in late 2015. Only one woman ran for any national seat. She lost in first round voting. Two women ran for local council seats. One lost in second round balloting, another did not win enough votes in first round voting. Many others are running for local councils. These include six who are independent candidates with no party affiliation. There are five parties which support women running for office. They are all Islamist groups except for the Social Democratic Party. That group supports some women candidates. However, none of them were successful in winning their races. Some people think there should be more gender equality in politics because many men hold positions like ministers and governors."

 ### Assistant: The Xbox One X is a home video game console made by Microsoft. It was released on November 7, 2017 in North America and Australia; it went to Europe and Japan two days later. The device can play all games for the original Xbox One and its successor, the Xbox Series X/S (released late 2020). Its hardware has been compared with that of Sony's PlayStation 4 Pro. However, while the PS4 Pro uses an AMD Jaguar CPU, the Xbox One X features eight cores based on AMD Zen architecture. Both consoles have GPUs based on AMD Radeon graphics cards. In comparison, Nintendo Switch does not feature a dedicated GPU or a custom CPU core. The Xbox One X also supports HDR displays. While the console itself costs $500 USD ($639 CAD), some retailers offered bundles including accessories such as headphones, controllers, and other items at lower prices. This bundle sold out quickly after launching. At the time, Microsoft said they would continue making them available when stock became more plentiful. The Xbox One X received positive reviews from critics. GameSpot gave it a score of nine out of ten, saying ""the best-looking system around"". IGN awarded the console a perfect ten, calling it ""the most powerful gaming machine you could possibly buy right now."" The Xbox One X beat sales expectations during the holiday season of 2018. By February 2019, over five million units had been shipped worldwide. As of October 2019, the Xbox One X holds the record for fastest selling piece of electronics ever sold online through Amazon.com. On April 16, 2019, Microsoft announced that there will be no new versions of the Xbox One family until the release of Project Scarlett in 2020. Instead, Microsoft will focus their efforts towards developing the next generation of both Xbox and Windows PC. The company plans to use the same technology found within this upcoming console across multiple devices, including mobile phones. For example, if someone buys an Xbox controller, they should be able to connect it into any compatible phone running either Android OS or iOS without needing additional software installed first. They hope these kinds of advancements help bridge what currently feels like separate"
75,"### Human: Can you propel in zero gravity by hiting yourself?
Example: hitting your chest with your hand?
 ### Assistant: No, because there's no force to push against. You can ""propell"" something without pushing it - for instance if the air is moving past a surface at speed V then there will be an air-pressure difference of 2V between front and back (if that makes sense). This pressure differential would cause the object to move forward as well. But since we don't have any air or other fluid around us, this doesn't happen either. So even though there are forces acting on our bodies all the time they just cancel out so there isn't anything left over which could make us accelerate like in Earth's gravity field. The only way to do this would be to put some kind of rocket engine onto ourselves but I doubt anyone wants to try that!

76,"### Human: What is Lao script and how does it differ from other writing systems?
 ### Assistant: Lao script (Lao language: ຄົມບິດ, khàm báy) or Lāo Tham () is a writing system used to write the Laotian languages. It was developed in the early part of the 13th century CE by Buddhist monks at Wat Xieng Khuan temple near Vientiane. The script has been adapted for use with both Latin-based alphabets as well as Devanagari scripts. This makes them suitable for use on computers running either Windows OS or Linux operating systems. History
The first known written records were found around AD 700–800 during the Khmer Empire's period when they controlled much of Southeast Asia including present day Cambodia, Myanmar, Thailand & Vietnam . During this time there are many inscriptions made into stone monuments which can be seen today such as Angkor Wat Temple Complex (Siem Reap Province). These writings show that people living here had access to knowledge about religion through books like Mahayana sutras translated directly from Pali texts brought over from India via Sri Lanka who ruled parts nearby before being conquered themselves later on by various dynasties across South East Asia throughout history until modern times where we now see an increase in literacy rates due mostly because schools have become more common place than ever before! In addition to these historical documents there exists another type called ""Lāo Tham"" (""Laoscript"") created sometime between then until now; its origin story varies depending upon whom one asks but most agree that it started out somewhere within central/northern regions close enough so locals could easily understand what was being said without needing translation services available only further south towards Bangkok area etc... The oldest surviving manuscript dated back circa year 1265 A.D., meaning roughly four hundred years after initial development took place - though some scholars believe earlier versions may exist too since no concrete evidence yet discovered proves otherwise despite thorough searches conducted thus far.. One thing worth mentioning however would probably pertain toward how similarities between old forms versus newer ones vary greatly based off contextual factors involved e g specific dialect spoken compared against others along same linguistic family tree branching off main trunk lineage pathways leading upwards downwardly sideways diagonally forward backwards whatever direction possible imaginable perhaps even impossible except"

From March 2003 through July 2007, she also served as Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha. In addition, she held several cabinet positions including those of Minister for Information Technology; Law & Justice; and Health & Family Welfare. She was a member of Parliament between 1996–2019. She represented the Vidisha constituency in Madhya Pradesh in the lower house of parliament. Before entering politics, she worked as an advocate at Supreme Court of India. Her career began with Janata Party in 1974 but later joined Bharatiya Jana Sangh before it became part of Bhartiya Janata Party. On 6 August 2019, Swaraj died after suffering cardiac arrest while undergoing kidney transplant surgery in New Delhi hospital aged 67. The organ donor was one of her sons. President Ram Nath Kovind said that ""she will always be remembered for her indomitable spirit"". Prime minister Narendra Modi wrote on Twitter saying “India grieves the demise of Smt Sushma Ji”. He added that he would miss his friend. Congress president Rahul Gandhi described her as ""an epitome of courage, strength and tenacity."" Former prime minister Manmohan Singh called her a ""true public servant"" who loved serving people. The Hindu newspaper noted how she had been ""a giant among women politicians"", adding that she ""was a powerful orator and effective administrator"". CNN-IBN praised her as a ""political firebrand"", while Aljazeera described her as a ""leadership icon"". A number of political leaders across party lines paid tribute to her.

 ### Assistant: Jessie, or Jessica Rabbit (born 1962) is a fictional character from Pixar's animated movie series Toy Story. She was created by John Lasseter for Disney/Pixar's first full-length feature film Toy Story released on November 20, 1995. The character is voiced by Joan Cusack who won an Annie Award as Best Female Voice Actress for this performance. Jessie has appeared in all four movies of the series including the latest one that came out June 21, 2019 titled Toy Story 4 where she is now part of Bonnie’s toy collection. Her catchphrase “Oh my!” comes up whenever something unexpected happens. In addition, when someone says ""Whoa!"", they will say ""Jessie!"" instead of Woody. This happened only once in Toy Story 3. However, it became more popular with fans afterward. Her real name is revealed at the end credits of Toy Story 2. It turns out that her name is actually Janet Walker. Because of this, many people think that Jessie should be pronounced like ""Janette"". But really, her name is spelled J E S S I E so you would have to pronounce it as such. This has been confirmed multiple times throughout the years since the release of Toy Story 2 in 1999. Even though there are no plans for another sequel to Toy Story 4 right now, director Josh Cooley said he had ideas for how their story could continue if there were any more films made. One idea involved bringing back some characters from previous installments while introducing new ones too. These include Bo Peep returning home but also getting married offscreen during these events. Other possibilities involve having Buzz Lightyear become President Of America later down line while Woody becomes Vice president under him due to his experience being leader beforehand. They even discussed making Andy's sister Molly into president herself someday because everyone loves kids growing up strong leaders themselves just like our current commander-in-chief Donald Trump himself did when becoming president last year despite losing reelection twice already overseas elections held every few months until next election day roll around again come fall time then winter holidays start rolling around shortly afterwards followed closely behind spring break season ending soon enough leaving summer vacation period starting soon after which leads us directly"
79,"### Human: What are the different roles of the parts in MIL-STD-1553 communication?
 ### Assistant: The MIL-STD 1553 is a bus used for data and control signals. It was first developed by Northrop Grumman to replace older systems like ARCNET or RS232/RS422. This standard has been widely adopted because it uses a high number of pins (up to 60). In this way, many functions can be implemented on one single board. For example, power supply, EMI protection, signal routing etc... There are several types of boards which have these functions integrated into them. They are called backplanes, they come in various sizes depending upon how much functionality you need. Backplane connectors are available from Digikey with up to 80 I/O points at once! A typical implementation would use two backplanes connected together via an interconnect cable so that all devices could communicate freely between each other without any restrictions imposed by their physical location within your system's chassis enclosure . These cables range anywhere from 1 meter long all the way down to just inches if needed due largely because there isn't enough room inside some cases where space constraints become critical factors when designing new products based around military standards such as MIL STAN 979A / B & C / D series specifications which were established years ago but still remain relevant today thanks mainly due its compatibility across multiple platforms including helicopters aircraft ships submarines tanks trucks cars trains locomotives satellites missiles rockets shuttles spaceships etc..

80,"### Human: Who is Chris Porter and what is his current status in professional ice hockey?
 ### Assistant: Christopher ""Chris"" Porter (born October 2, 1985) is an American former professional ice hockey right winger. He played a career total of 30 games in the National Hockey League (NHL). His last game was on January 7, 2014 with the Los Angeles Kings against the Anaheim Ducks. Career
Before playing for the NHL's St. Louis Blues, he had played college ice hockey at Cornell University from 2006 to 2010. In June 2010, he signed as a free agent with the Chicago Blackhawks but did not make it through training camp with them or any other team during that year. On December 17, 2010, he went back into the AHL after being assigned by the Blackhawks. During this time, he would play with both the Rockford IceHogs and Peoria Rivermen before finally making his way up to the big leagues when he made his first appearance on April 7th, 2011 versus the Calgary Flames. After appearing in six more games over two seasons, he left the Blackhawks organization in order to sign with their divisional rivals, the Detroit Red Wings. With Detroit, he only appeared in four regular season contests. He then spent most of the next three years bouncing around between various minor league teams including the Grand Rapids Griffins, Toronto Marlies, Iowa Wild, Lake Erie Monsters, Milwaukee Admirals, and Hershey Bears. It wasn’t until February 2nd, 2016 where he got another shot at the NHL level when he joined the New York Rangers following a trade deadline deal involving Jayson Megna. The Rangers also included Brandon Pirri and a conditional draft pick in exchange for Porter. However, once again, he didn’t stick very long. Just under one month later, he was traded away along with Ryan McDonagh and J.T. Miller for Martin St. Louis and Eric Lindros. This move came just days ahead of the March 1st NHL Trade Deadline. Following this trade, he was dealt off to the Tampa Bay Lightning who were looking to add some depth to their forward lineup. Once there though, things weren’t going too well either"

 ### Assistant: The Jeopardy! Teen Tournament (also known as JTT) was a tournament on the game show, Jeopardy!. It started in 1986 and ended in 2005. In this tournament, there are three contestants who play against each other for two days to win $75,000. On the first day, they answer questions about pop culture trivia from the past year. On the second day, they must give answers based only on categories that have been chosen by the host Alex Trebek. They will also be given clues during Final Jeopardy!, which is at the end of every round except Round One. This tournament has one final round where all three players compete together for the grand prize of $75,000. If someone wins both rounds then he or she gets an extra bonus question worth up to another $3,000 per player if it's answered correctly before time runs out; however no matter what happens afterward everyone still keeps their winnings even though nobody actually won anything else besides money because there were no prizes involved with winning either way since everything had already happened by then so everyone just got paid off anyway regardless whether anyone won anything specific like trips abroad etcetera . There hasn't been any new episodes made yet but we can hope someday soon enough maybe again maybe not I don't know what will happen next but hopefully something good does come around eventually somehow somewhere somewhen whenever when ughh okay well see ya later folks take care now peace out god bless everybody stay safe keep your heads down low & go get em tiger!!!!!

82,"### Human: What is a tray and what is it used for?
 ### Assistant: A tray, also called a platter or dish (in British English), is an object that can hold food. It usually has one flat surface on which the food sits; other surfaces may be curved to make serving easier. Trays are often made of metal, wood or ceramics. They come in different sizes depending on how much they need to carry. The most common size is 30 cm × 25 cm (12 inches × 10 inches). In some countries people use small round trays as saucers under tea cups. Large ones with handles are sometimes used instead of boxes when transporting goods by post. Some trays have legs so they do not slide around easily while being carried. Others lie flat on the floor. People who work in kitchens often wear special aprons with pockets where they put cooking utensils such as pots and knives. These are kept safe from getting dirty because they hang down inside the pocket below the waistline. Sometimes these pockets contain compartments for storing things like salt and pepper shakers. This way you always know exactly where your spices are without having to dig through all those drawers looking for them every time!

83,"### Human: What is an anvil used for?
 ### Assistant: An anvil (also called a standing stone, or stepping-stone) is a heavy block of metal. It can be used as a workbench and to hold hot objects while they are being worked on with hammers and chisels. The word comes from the Latin word ""anvilum"". This means hammer in English. In most cases it's made out of steel or cast iron but some anvils were made out of bronze too. There have been found many examples of ancient anvils all over Europe that date back more than 2000 years. One example was found at Alesia which dates back about 165 BC. Another one has been found near Mons in Belgium dating back around AD 374–394. Some people think that this type of tool may even go further back into history. Many civilizations had tools like these before writing was invented so we don’t know how old exactly they are. These include Egyptians, Mesopotamians, Sumerians etc.. But regardless when exactly they began using them - there will always remain mystery behind why such simple things became important part of our culture! 
Anvils come in different shapes depending what their purpose would be. They usually consist either flat surface area where you could put something underneath it; round bottom part where object gets placed onto its center point then heated up until desired temperature reaches maximum level possible without melting material completely away yet still keeping enough heat inside itself long enough period time required by process involved herein order achieve best results achievable within given constraints set forth prior beginning operation performed upon said piece(s). Anvils are also commonly used during blacksmithing processes because they provide stability needed throughout entire duration procedure takes place since every single move needs careful consideration taken into account considering weight distribution across whole structure along side potential impact force exerted against each other due changes applied simultaneously between both sides resulting ultimately resultant product produced through various stages completed successfully afterwards completion achieved once again proving effectiveness reliability provided services rendered effectively efficiently thus far now moving forward towards future endeavors await us ahead eagerly anticipate see unfold right before eyes very soon indeed!!
The first known use of anvils appears to be sometime after 800 BCE. It wasn't until later though that smelters started making large ones specifically designed for metalsmithing purposes rather than just general construction projects requiring small pieces cut out quickly & easily"
84,"### Human: Which material has the highest power to weight ratio when used as a spring?
In the construction of quite large springs (a clockspring) in the order of several KG of weight, what is the most efficient material interms of power stored in the spring to weight of the spring? Is there a list of materials somewhere that has the apprx. amount of Joules one can store in the material when used as a spring?
 ### Assistant: I'm not sure if this will be useful for you but . The graph shows how much force it takes to deform something by some percentage and how stiff/hard the substance is at room temperature. You want your metal or plastic to have high hardness because then less energy needs to be put into deformation before yielding. If its too soft though then it won't hold any shape under stress so you don't get much elongation out of it. Also note that different alloys are on the same chart so you need to consider which alloy is best suited for your application. For example 60-40 brass would probably work well since it has good tensile strenh and ductility while being easy to machine. But 316L stainless steel might also do fine even with higher yield strengths than other metals. As far as storing more potential energy per unit mass goes we typically look at Youngs modulus rather than hardness alone due to its dependence on both density & cross sectional area; which means two things happen simultaneously during loading - volume decreases while surface increases causing greater strain rate sensitivity leading towards failure faster than pure hardness measures alone suggest possible without knowing exact geometry details first hand like radius etc... So another way people often think about this problem instead involves using Poisson ratios where E = k(1 – v^2)/[1 + v(1–v)] where k=E/V^2+p/(1−v)...etc. This equation basically says ""how much does an object stretch along axis A vs B?"" When considering bending moments then E becomes relevant again since now only axis C matters compared against axis D whereas previously they were all equally important regardless whether each point was closer together physically speaking thereby resulting in less effective use overall unless otherwise specified explicitly ahead time via appropriate design choices made early enough prior anything else happening later downstream within contextual framework itself herewith reference given above referenced source material citation footnote bibliography appendix appendices appendix appendices appendix appendix appendices appendix appendices appendix appendix appendices appendix appendix appendix appendix appendix appendix Appendix Appendix Appendix Appendix Appendix Appendix Appendix Appendix Appendix Appendix Appendix Appendix Appendix Appendix Appendix Appendix Appendix Appendix Appendix Appendix Appendix Appendix Appendix Appendix Appendix Appendix Appendix Append"

 ### Assistant: Sir Conrad Moffatt ""Con"" Black, Baron Black of Crossharbour (born 25 August 1944), also known as Lord Black of Crossharbour or simply Lord Black, is a British-Canadian author and former media executive. He was the chairman and CEO of Hollinger International from 1986 to December 2003 when he resigned in disgrace after being charged with fraud by US authorities. The charges were later dropped. On 7 October 2007, Black pleaded guilty on one count of mail fraud for his role in a scheme involving the sale of some newspapers owned by Hollinger Inc., which he had once controlled. In January 2009, he began serving an eighteen month sentence at a federal prison near Miami Beach, Florida. His wife Barbara Amiel joined him there in June 2010. Black served only seven months before getting out early due to good behaviour. Since leaving jail, Black has written several books including Billionaire: A Memoir . As well as publishing two volumes of memoires, Black's first novel, Best Laid Plans , was published in November 2011. It tells about the events that led up to his arrest and imprisonment. On 1 April 2011, it became clear that Black would be released three years earlier than expected because of time already spent behind bars awaiting trial. Black was born into a wealthy Scottish family living in Toronto, Ontario. His father was George Grant Black (died 1978) who worked for Imperial Oil Ltd.. His mother was Mary Kathleen Macdonald (née McGregor; died 1985). Black went to Upper Canada College where he played football and hockey. Then he studied history at Trinity Hall, Cambridge University between 1965–1968. After university, Black worked briefly for the Canadian Broadcast Corporation (CBC). From 1971 until 1985 he wrote articles for magazines such as Time magazine and Vanity Fair. Between 1985 and 1993, he lived in Chicago working for the Sun-Times Media Group. There he bought the Chicago Sun Times newspaper from Rupert Murdoch. Later he sold this paper back to News Corp. In 1994, Black"
86,"### Human: What were mastabas made from and when were they built?
 ### Assistant: Mastaba is the name for a kind of burial tomb that was used in Ancient Egypt. They are sometimes called step pyramids because there are steps going up to them, just like stairs or stepping stones. The word ""mastaba"" comes from Arabic مَسْتَبَاح‎ (mas'tabaḥ). It means something piled on top of each other. This refers to how these ancient structures were stacked one upon another. These burial places have been found all over Egypt but most often near the Nile Delta region where people lived at those times. Most of them date back to between about 4000 BC - 2575 BC. Many mastabe-like buildings have also been discovered throughout Mesopotamia during this same period. Some scholars believe that some forms of architecture may even go as far back as prehistorical man. However, it has not yet been proven if any form of building existed before then. In fact, many experts think we do not know enough yet about early human history to be able to say what exactly happened thousands of years ago with certainty. One thing seems clear though; humans began making their own shelters by around 18,000 BCE. Afterward, stone tools started being produced more regularly than ever before which led us into using fire much earlier than previously thought possible. As time went on, our ability to use metals grew stronger until eventually iron became commonplace sometime after 3600 BCE. Soon afterwards came copper followed closely behind bronze. Then came steel which wasn’t perfected until long after its discovery somewhere around 900 CE. By now you should understand why archaeologists refer so frequently towards “the dawn” since everything prior falls under an unspecified category known only through inference rather than direct observation due largely in part thanks science fiction movies! And lastly come computers/smartphones etcetera...which brings me full circle again—but this time armed w/ knowledge gained thru study & research instead of imagination alone! So yeah…basically speaking masts aren’t anything special anymore except maybe having cool names depending who u ask lol.. Anyways hope I helped clarify things here today folks! Cheers~

 ### Assistant: Redfield is a city in Montgomery County, Kansas, United States. In 2010 census, 567 people lived there. History
Redfield was first called ""Clarke's Station"". It was named after J. A. Clarke who settled there around 1874. The name was shortened to just ""Station"" and then finally changed to its current form when it became an incorporated township on January 30, 1904. Geography
The United States Census Bureau says that the city has a total area of . All of it land. Climate
According to the Köppen climate classification system, Redfield has a hot-summer humid continental climate (Dfa). Detailed weather information for this region can be found at the following link: <https://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weathersummary.php> The average annual temperature is about 52 °F or 11° C. About 33 inches or 84 cm of precipitation falls annually. Winter temperatures are often below freezing with lows reaching -5 F (-21° C) or lower. Summers tend to be very warm, but not extremely so. Temperatures above 90 degrees Fahrenheit occur only a few days per year. There is usually no snow accumulation. Humidity tends to increase during summer months. On average, there are 215 sunny days and 94 cloudy days each year. Celebrities from Redfield include actress Sally Field; country musician Don Edwards; baseball player Mickey Mantle; singer Patty Loveless; former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright; and actor John Wayne.
Redfield is also home to one of the largest grain elevators west of the Mississippi River, which can hold over 2 million bushels. This facility is owned by Farmland Industries. Farming plays a major role in the economy of Redfield as well as surrounding areas. Livestock farming is also commonplace throughout the county. Ranchers run cattle herds across vast expanses of prairie grassland. Local businesses provide services such as veterinary care and feed stores where ranchers purchase hay bales among other items needed daily while raising livestock.

88,"### Human: What is King Edward VII School known for?
 ### Assistant: King Edward VII School (also called KEGS) is a boys' independent school in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire. It was founded by the Revd Henry Clayton on 17 January 1856 as ""The Grammar-school of King Edwards VI and Queen Mary"". The original building no longer exists; it has been replaced three times since then. In 2014, there were about 390 pupils aged between 11–18 years old at the school. There are also many alumni around the world who have gone to other schools or universities after leaving here. History
In 1856, the Reverend Henry Clayton started this grammar school with 16 students. At that time, he had just left his position as headmaster of St John's College, Oxford. He became its first Head Master until retiring in 1882 when he died two months later. In those days, the curriculum included Latin up to the end of the First Form year but Greek was not taught because they did not know how long it would take them all to learn enough about it before moving onto something else. However, if you wanted more than one language while studying Classics, French could be added from Second Year onwards instead - which meant having an extra lesson each week during term time only! After retirement, Mr. Clayton continued teaching privately at home until his death at age eighty seven. His successor was Dr J H Smyth whose son went through their ranks too so I suppose we can say 'third generation'. When asked what made him choose KEGS over any others back then, he replied simply ''It felt like coming home'' This feeling seems pretty common among ex-pupils today although some people may disagree depending upon personal preference etc... But regardless whether someone likes sports/music/art etc., everyone agrees that being part of such a special place makes life worth living even though sometimes things aren’t perfect…but then again nothing ever really will be right???. So yes indeed..there IS always room for improvement!! As far as current affairs go however?, well let me tell ya', there hasn't been much going down lately except maybe some minor changes within certain departments due mainly due mostly likely because staffing levels dropped significantly last year meaning teachers weren't able attend classes regularly anymore :( .

 ### Assistant: Salford () is a city in Greater Manchester, England. It has been part of the City of Manchester since 1974. History
Salford was once an independent township on its own. In 2003 it had more than 185,000 people living there. The name ""Salford"" comes from Old English words which mean 'the river crossing' or 'ford'. This refers to where the River Irwell flows through the city centre. In the Middle Ages this ford (or bridge) carried a Roman road across the river. There are records that go back as far as AD640 mentioning the location. At one time the area was covered with peat bogs. These were drained by monks who built bridges over them. They then settled here because they found good grazing land for their animals. Over time the area became known as Salfords Heath. By the end of the 17th century many houses had been built around the heathland. Many of these buildings still stand today. Some have even survived two World Wars. During the Industrial Revolution the Irwell Valley attracted large numbers of workers looking for jobs at mills along the canal system. Much of what remains today dates from this period including the Grade II listed Lowry House Museum. In 1889 the borough council built Lark Hill Park. This was later renamed Alexandra Park after Queen Victoria's daughter-in-law Princess Alexandra of Denmark. Today it covers . It contains a boating lake, sports fields, playgrounds, tennis courts and a miniature railway. It also includes a children's zoo called Worsley Zoo. To the north east of the park is Pendleton Lancashire County Cricket Club Ground. South of the park lies Ordsall Hall. Built between 1391–1399, it is now owned by Salford Council but managed by the National Trust. Its grounds include the ruins of a moated medieval castle. It also features a Victorian walled garden, orchard and vegetable gardens. From 1846 until 1933, Salford was home to St Philip's Church, Blackfriars Road, London EC4Y 8BT, United Kingdom. This church was designed by Sir George Gilbert Scott and completed in 1850"

Since 1972 they have played their home games at Gillette Stadium. From 1960 to 2003 and again from 2005 onward, they were playing their home games at Fenway Park. Their current head coach is Bill Belichick since 2000. He has coached them to six Super Bowl wins. The franchise was founded by Billy Sullivan Jr., who bought it outright with his brother John Y. Sullivan Sr. after its first season ended without any profits. In 1994, Robert Kraft purchased the team. It became one of only three teams that had never missed postseason competition during this period; along with Green Bay Packers & Pittsburgh Steelers. As well as being known as ""The Original Six"", because no other league can claim such longevity or success within these parameters either before or since then. History

91,"### Human: why is the us the only country, apart from liberia and burma, not to have adopted the international system of units?

 ### Assistant: I think you might be interested in this post. It's about 5 years old but still relevant today.  The short answer though is that it costs money for the US government to change all their standards overnight (and they are very much aware how much stuff there actually is out there). So until we get a new president who doesn't give two shits about science or research funding, no one will do anything. And don't expect the rest of the world to follow suit either - most countries just use what works best for them at any given time, which can mean using imperial measurements here and SI elsewhere depending on whatever was invented first where/when. Some examples would include China, India, Russia, Indonesia, Australia etc.. Basically anywhere with an older scientific tradition than the US because they were colonized by Europeans before the metric system came into being. This also means that while the US has a lot of influence, it does NOT dictate global standardization unless everyone wants to play along. Also worth mentioning that the United States did adopt the metric system back in the late 1800s as part of its ""Mendenhall Order"" which redefined length based off of meters instead of feet. In fact, the meter used to define the yard prior to 2019 was defined relative to a prototype meter kept at NIST. But again, this didn't really catch on outside of academics & scientists since many people had already gotten used to other ways of measuring things. And so now we live in a world full of different measurement systems! Fun times... Anyways hope some of this helps :) If anyone needs more information feel free to ask away!

92,"### Human: What is a handshake and how is it used in different cultures?
 ### Assistant: A handshake, also called a fist bump or pound, is when two people touch their hands together. This can be done with one of the palms facing upwards (a ""high five""), sideways (""bro-fist"" or ""pound"") or downward (""low five"").  The way that this happens differs between countries. In some places like Germany, shaking someone's hand might mean that you are showing respect to them; however, in other parts of Europe such as France, Spain or Italy they do not usually give each other high fives because they think this is too informal for business meetings. Handshakes are often given at formal events where there may have been an introduction beforehand by another person who will introduce both parties involved so everyone knows what should happen next during these types of situations which require etiquette rules being followed closely since otherwise things could go wrong easily enough due lack knowledge about proper protocols etcetera...
The practice has evolved over time into its modern form. It was first recorded in Ancient Egypt around 1500 BC but wasn’t common until later periods like Roman times (6th century AD). During Medieval Period, handshakes became more popular among nobles than peasants/serfs while lower class citizens were still doing simple nods instead due mainly poverty issues related mostly towards food shortages caused largely from poor harvests across most regions back then anyway! Today we see lots variations depending on culture though most western societies use standard greeting methods nowadays except maybe Japan whose customary gesture involves bowing slightly forward with arms outstretched away from body - quite unique compared others I must say :)
A handshake is the act of using your right hand to grasp another person's left hand firmly. You hold onto his wrist lightly with your fingers spread apart so he doesn't get hurt if you let him go suddenly—and don't squeeze hard either way! If this sounds complicated try practicing once or twice without actually meeting anyone face-to-face yet. Then repeat several times after getting acquainted with new friends at school or workplace settings alike.

 ### Assistant: The Gulf of Salerno (, ) or Bay of Naples () is a large bay in Southern Italy. It opens into the Tyrrhenian Sea and forms part of the Campania region. It has two capes at its ends; Cape Palinuro to the west and Capo Posillipo to the east. Its largest city is Salerno. Other cities on this coast are Amalfi, Benevento, Avellino, Ischia, Nocera Inferiore-Sarno, Vibo Valentia, Reggio Calabria, Agropoli, Sapri and Cetara. The gulf was formed by marine sedimentation during Quaternary glaciations. There are many bays along the shores of the Gulf of Salerno. They include Fondi, Formia, Gaeta, Pozzuoli, Procida, Napoli, Castel Volturno, Sant'Agata di Puglia and Montecorvino Rovella. The main rivers flowing through these areas include Garigliano, Liri, Sabato, Tammaro, Tanagro, Tramontana, Miscano, Sanza, Acquaro, Avella, Verde, Sacco, Mercureto, Variante, Sele, Ofanto, Irno, Bifone and Basento. The climate is Mediterranean with hot summers and mild winters. Snowfall occurs rarely but there have been cases where snow covered some parts of the area for several days due to cold fronts from Northern Europe. The highest temperature recorded here was 46°C on August 25th, 1903 near Casalnuovo di Napoli. This record could be broken again soon as global warming continues to raise temperatures worldwide. On December 7th, 1857 an earthquake struck the region causing major damage especially around Naples which had just experienced another one only three months earlier killing about 11 thousand people according to official estimates while unofficial sources claim that more than twenty five thousands perished under rubble caused by liquefaction phenomena triggered after strong ground vibrations registered at nearby Mount Somma volcano located within Vesuvius National Park. These events happened shortly before dawn when most inhabitants were still sleeping unaware until loud noises woke them up scaring everyone away from their homes leaving behind dead bodies scattered"
94,"### Human: What is the name of the hit song by Right Said Fred that reached the top 5 in the English charts?
 ### Assistant: ""I'm Too Sexy"" (or just ""Sexy"") is a pop rock dance-pop and funk single. It was released on August 24, 1991 as part of their second studio album, Up. The music video for this song was filmed at Leicester Square in London. In the United Kingdom it peaked at number five. This made them one of only three acts to have two singles reach the UK Top Ten from an album which did not chart within its first week of release. They are also one of few artists who had four consecutive hits reaching the British Top Ten between 1987 and 1993. It sold over half million copies worldwide. That makes it one of the best selling songs ever recorded. It has been covered by many different singers including Kylie Minogue, Puddles Pity Party, Tara McDonald, Beverley Knight, and others. American rapper MC Hammer sampled the track into his own version called ""Too Legit"". On October 6, 2007, the band performed the song live with Snoop Dogg during the closing ceremony of the Rugby World Cup in Paris. On March 31, 2010 they played the song again along with other tracks such as Deeply Dippy, I Love You So Much More Than You Will Ever Know, Don't Go Out Alone Tonight and Let Me Be Your Fantasy. This time it was the opening act of the Eurovision Song Contest held in Oslo, Norway. The group were later honoured with an award presented to them at the 2011 NRJ Music Awards in Cannes, France. Later, the song appeared on BBC Radio 2's 25 Years at Wembley compilation CD/DVD set alongside other famous performers like Queen, Take That, Elton John, George Michael, Tom Jones, Oasis, Rod Stewart, Diana Ross & Lionel Richie and more. The song can be heard in the 2013 movie Identity Thief starring Melissa McCarthy and Jason Bateman. A cover version appears in the soundtrack of the 2014 Disney Channel Original Movie Teen Beach Movie. It also appears in the 2016 film Sing Street. It was featured in the trailer for the animated comedy series Harvey Street Kids"
95,"### Human: What are chiggers and what are their characteristics?
 ### Assistant: Chigger is the larvae of a type of mite. They live in grass, weeds or other plants that have not been disturbed by human activity for many years. The adult female mites do not bite people; instead they lay eggs on plant leaves. When these hatch into tiny white worms called larvae (or nymph), it takes about 10 days before they become full grown. Then they go back to hiding underground where no one can see them until next year when all over again begins! There are several different species but most commonly found ones include Trombiculidae family members such as Dermatobia hominis which causes severe reactions like rashes after being bitten while another example would be Leptotrombidium pallidum who cause similar symptoms except more painful due its longer mouthparts used during feeding time between meals etcetera... These two types usually occur only within certain geographical regions around North America so if someone wants protection against either kind then there's an easy way out - simply avoid those areas altogether since both will never leave unless forced upon humans through some means e g accidental contact with clothing item containing infected particles from previous victim(s). If this happens however please seek medical attention immediately because otherwise you could end up suffering long term consequences including possible death depending how bad things get later down line.

96,"### Human: What is the plot of the television show ""Gloria""?
 ### Assistant: Gloria is an American sitcom that aired on ABC from 1982 to 1983. It was about the life of Gloria, who works as a waitress at The Hungry Hound restaurant in New York City and lives with her husband Stan. Plot
In each episode, Gloria's mother Norma comes over for dinner and brings along some problems she has been having in her own home. At first it seems like they are going to help each other out but then something happens which makes them both angry at one another. Afterwards, Gloria goes back into the kitchen while Norma stays outside until everyone else leaves so that they can talk things through without anyone listening. This continues throughout most episodes except when there is no food left because someone forgot what day it was or how much money had already gone towards paying bills beforehand (which happened twice). Whenever this occurs, Norma will go straight upstairs instead of waiting down below where everything takes place during normal times! As you might expect though--since we live in modern society nowadays--things don’t always turn out well between these two women despite all their hard work trying otherwise…and sometimes even worse than expected since neither knows exactly what caused such misfortune either way around.”

98,"### Human: Who is William Thomas Rodgers?
 ### Assistant: William Thomas ""Bill"" Rodgers (born September 23, 1947) is an American politician and author. He was a member of the United States House of Representatives from Massachusetts's first congressional district for three terms between 1975 to 1981. In 1976 he ran in the Democratic Party presidential primaries but lost the nomination to Jimmy Carter who won that year's general election against incumbent President Gerald Ford. After his time as representative, he became Governor of New Hampshire serving one term before leaving office after two years. He later served on several boards including those at Harvard University and Northeastern University where he teaches politics today. Biography
Rodgers was born in Washington D.C., but raised in Newton Center, Massachussets. His parents were both teachers. At age eight, his family moved to Lexington, Massachusetts which they would live until moving to California when Bill was fifteen. There, he graduated high school and went on to study political science at Stanford University graduating with honors. From there, he attended Yale Law School where he received his JD degree in law. While studying, he worked part-time for Senator Edward Kennedy. When asked why he decided not to run for Congress or Senate himself instead opting to work for others like Kennedy, Rodgers said it came down to wanting to do things rather than talk about them. As such, he left politics behind him while still young enough to return if he so wished. Today, however, this seems unlikely given how many people are trying their hand at being politicians nowadays! During college, Rodger met future wife Nancy Sherman whom he married shortly afterwards. They had four children together before divorcing in 2007 due mostly because she felt neglected by her husband during much of his career; something which caused tension within their relationship leading up towards separation eventually culminating into eventual dissolution through court order. Despite this breakup though, Rodgers continued living happily ever since then without any major problems arising whatsoever despite rumours circulated throughout media outlets regarding infidelity allegations made against former First Lady Hillary Clinton back around mid-nineties period during Bill’s presidency days - all these claims turned out false once investigators conducted thorough examinations following reports surfaced online detailing evidence proving otherwise; thus putting paid rum"
99,"### Human: Who is Percival Noel James Patterson?
 ### Assistant: Percival Noel James Patterson (born 28 June 1947) is a Jamaican politician. He was the Minister of Education from October 3, 2016 to September 5, 2018. He has also been Leader of the Opposition in Parliament since August 2017. In April 2020 he became Prime Minister and leader of the People's National Party after Andrew Holness stepped down due to his party losing the election for the House of Representatives on March 3. His term ended when Peter Phillips won the general election held later that month. He resigned as prime minister shortly afterwards because he had tested positive for COVID-19 during the campaign period before the election. The office of prime minister fell vacant until Phillip Brown was sworn into office by Governor General Nigel Clarke. Patterson would be able to hold both offices at once if it were not against constitutional law; this happened with Edward Seaga who served as PM while still holding the office of opposition leader. This is currently allowed only under special circumstances such as a state of emergency or war. As well, an MP can serve as either speaker or deputy speaker but never both simultaneously. The last time two different people have held these positions was between Alexander Bustamante and Norman Manley back in 1949. During his tenure as education minister, Patterson oversaw a plan to increase literacy rates among children aged five through twelve years old. It aimed to ensure all students learn how read and write properly so they could enter primary school ready to learn more complex topics like math. By doing this project, many schools across Jamaica improved their teaching methods which led to better test scores than ever before! For example, some teachers started using computers instead of chalkboards whenever possible - something unheard of just twenty years ago!. Also importantly, parents began helping out where needed rather than expecting everything done solely by staff members alone—a huge change considering most families didn’t even own televisions until recently anyway let along laptops/tablets etcetera… Lastly there are now new programs designed specifically around science subjects including robotics classes too...so no matter what level your child starts off learning things will get easier overtime thanks largely due those changes implemented throughout various parts society today .
