0,"### Human: why places price stuff ""15.99"" instead of just ""16""
I've always wondered, but I just spoke to a friend who mentioned this and I couldn't find a better reason than ""because it looks cheaper"".
 ### Assistant: This is an article about the number 16 (sixteen). For other uses see Sixteen (disambiguation)
The number 16 has many meanings in maths, science and religion. In Roman numerals, 16 is XVI. The 16th day of any month on the Gregorian calendar falls between January 27 and February 3. In binary code, 16 means hexadecimal numbers starting with 0x. The 16-bit computer word was used by early computers like the ZX Spectrum. It had sixteen bits which could be combined together to make up one whole piece of information called a byte. A modern personal computer will have four or eight bytes at once. Sometimes people put prices for things as $15.99 when they really should say $16 because it seems less expensive that way even though both are exactly equal amounts of money! You might also hear someone say something costs ""fifty bucks,"" which actually means fifty dollars ($50), not five thousand dollars ($5,000). There are 16 days in each week except weeks where there isn’t any weekend holiday such as Labor Day Weekend or Memorial Day Weekend; these special cases don’t count towards your total amount due until after those dates pass so if you pay rent every two months then technically speaking only thirteen months go into making up twelve full payments per year. Someone born during Leap Year would celebrate their birthday twice annually--once during regular years (February 28th) followed closely behind them being able to enjoy another round of festivities come March 1st. The next time this happens again won’t occur until 2048. People usually think of 16 candles as what teenagers blow out while wishing themselves luck before going off alone somewhere without parental supervision...but did you know? They can also symbolize freedom from adolescent shackles such as curfew times set forth by parents/guardians alike - no matter how young or old we may become throughout life itself."" And finally…if ever asked about how much longer till graduation day arrives here comes along yet another reminder courtesy Of Mr. Einstein himself stating quite plainly enough “time flies faster than speeding bullets” So please remember: Don't let anyone tell YOU otherwise!! Cheers!!!"""
1,"### Human: why is car insurance mandatory, but mandatory health insurance is ""unconstitutional""?

 ### Assistant: Car insurance (also called auto insurance) is a type of insurance policy that primarily protects the driver and passengers in an automobile. It also covers liability for bodily injury or death to others caused by motor vehicle accidents. Most countries require drivers to buy car insurance before they can legally drive on public roads. In most states it is illegal not have car insurance if you own a car. The only state where this isn't true is New Hampshire. However, car insurance is required there as well, just under different laws. Health care reform in the United States has been highly controversial. Many conservatives think it would be unconstitutional because it forces people to purchase something even though they don't want it. Yet many Americans are forced to carry auto insurance when driving their cars. If one does not comply with these requirements then he/she will face penalties such as being fined or having his/her license suspended. This law is considered constitutional since it was passed through Congress which makes all laws valid unless overturned by higher courts like Supreme Court decisions; however there hasn’t been any ruling made yet regarding whether requiring individuals who do not wish too pay into private companies providing them coverage against potential risks associated with owning vehicles qualifies as violating anyone’s rights under 14th Amendment clause prohibiting deprivation without due process protections afforded criminal defendants prior conviction after trial conducted fairly according established legal standards set forth Constitution Article III section II article V clause I amendments VI VII VIII IX X XI XII XIII XIV XV XVI XVII XVIII XIX XX XXI XXII XXIII XXIV XXV XXVI XXVII XXVIII XXIX XXX XXXI thirty-two thirty three thirty four thirty five thirty six thirty seven thirty eight thirty nine forty ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty twenty-one twenty two twenty three twenty four twenty five twenty six twenty seven twenty eight twenty nine thirty zero thirty one thirty two thirty three thirty four thirty five thirty six thirty seven thirty eight thirty nine forty ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty twenty-one twenty two twenty three twenty four twenty five twenty six twenty seven twenty eight twenty nine thirty zero thirty one thirty two thirty three thirty four thirty five thirty six thirty seven thirty eight thirty nine forty ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen"
2,"### Human: why cursive writing exists and why we still use it today

 ### Assistant: Cursive is a style of handwriting in which the letters are joined together. In English, many people learned to write this way at school when they were young children. They wrote by making their hands move quickly across paper so that all the words would be connected. This type of script was used for centuries before printing became commonplace during medieval times; however, even after Gutenberg invented his famous press machine (which helped make books cheaper), there remained some places where only scribes could read what had been written down on parchment scrolls or vellum pages made from animal skin rather than papyrus sheets cut into strips like those found inside Egyptian mummies' tombs! Today most people don’t know how to do this kind of thing anymore because computers have replaced pens/pencils as our main method of recording information onto documents such as letters sent through mailboxes instead of being delivered directly via postman who brings them straight home without having gone anywhere else first except maybe stopping off somewhere along route just long enough grab lunch break while waiting around until someone comes back later with whatever package you ordered online earlier today using credit card number stored securely away safe place nobody else knows about unless told otherwise specifically asked permission granted beforehand prior agreement reached between parties involved transaction taking place now here present moment time currently occupying attention span focus point interest concern subject matter object purpose goal end result desired outcome expected conclusion final destination last stop terminus station where journey ends stops moving forward again resumes progressing towards completion finish line ultimate objective accomplishment achievement attainable target aim sought pursued strived towards obtained won earned received gained acquired acquired procured captured seized appropriated confiscated taken possession over claimed ownership rightful authority righteous entitlement lawfully legitimate deserved due deserving proper suitable fitting worthy merited entitled warranted qualified eligible allowed authorized legal licensed sanctioned approved accepted recognised acknowledged permitted permissible tolerated condoned given consent agreed concurred assented acceded consented affirmed acquiesced conformed yielded conceded capitulated complied submitted deferred relinquished surrendered abided adhered accorded subscribed gave way caved in went along came round seen sense come around changed opinion altered viewpoint softened hardline position compromised abandoned opposition dropped resistance accepted terms conditions laid down agreed upon settled dispute amicably resolved conflict peacefully ended hostilities negotiations concluded successfully completed truce established treat"
3,"### Human: why my stomach ""growl"" and make noise?

 ### Assistant: The sound of the human digestive system is known as borborygmi. It can be heard by others, or simply felt in one's own body. This happens when air passes through the intestines during digestion. Sometimes it sounds like a growling or rumbling. A more common name for this phenomenon is 'stomach gurgle'. When you are hungry your stomach will often make noises to let you know that you need food. There have been many scientific studies done on what causes these noises and how they work. One study found that people who eat fast tend to produce less noise than those who take their time eating. Another study showed that women made louder noises than men did while eating breakfast cereal. Some researchers believe that some types of bacteria may cause different amounts of gas production which leads to varying levels of noise from each individual person’s gut microbiome (the population of living organisms inside someone’s intestinal tract). Other scientists think there could also be other reasons such as dietary habits leading up to mealtime or even genetic factors playing into whether someone has loud or quiet bowel movements after consuming certain food items over others . In any case though most everyone agrees we all should try our best not worry about whatever kind(or lack)of “noise” comes out whenever somebody goes number two! 
In 2017, a team at University College London published an article explaining how humans hear their own internal organs making noise. They say that people with autism spectrum disorder are better able to perceive these noises because of their sensitivity to low-frequency sounds. People without ASD usually do not notice them unless they become very loud. According to Professor Philip Burnet, director of UCL's Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, this ability helps explain why children diagnosed with autism often show signs before age five years old—a point where nonverbal communication becomes difficult due to language development delays caused by differences between normal brains versus ones affected by neurodevelopmental conditions including ASD.” He added,”It makes sense that if you were born unable to speak but had good hearing then being able detect subtle changes would help you survive."" 
The findings suggest that early detection might lead towards earlier intervention strategies designed specifically around helping individuals develop social skills needed later down life path"
4,"### Human: why couldn't edward snowden return to america, where he would need to face a proper and fair trial, and appeal his case until it reaches the supreme court?

 ### Assistant: Edward Joseph Snowden (born June 21, 1983) is an American computer specialist. He was born in North Carolina. He worked for the National Security Agency (NSA). In May 2013, he gave information about how the NSA collects data from people around the world to The Guardian newspaper. After this, he went to Hong Kong, then Russia. Because of what he did, some people think that he should be tried as a criminal. Other people say that he helped make America more free by telling everyone about what the government does with their private information. On August 1, 2013, Snowden applied for political asylum in Russia. His application has been approved, but he cannot leave Moscow airport because there are no direct flights between Russia and Latin America. As of December 27, 2013, the U.S. Government says they will not seek extradition if he wants to go back home. It is unknown whether or not he still plans on going back to America, where he would need to face a proper and fair trial, and appeal his case until it reaches the Supreme Court. If convicted at all, he could get up to life imprisonment. However, according to some legal experts, under international law, which the United States follows, whistleblowers like him have protection against being prosecuted. This includes when the person who leaks classified material is outside the country doing so. There is also the possibility of clemency after serving time. Clemency can happen even though Snowden may have done something illegal, such as revealing secrets. Also, the US government might want Snowden back just so they don’t look bad in front of other countries. They do not want foreign governments saying “the Americans won’t let us try our own citizens fairly”. According to Glenn Greenwald, one of the reporters working with Snowden, he said ""I never intended my disclosures to harm the united states"". For now, he remains in exile.
He wrote a book called Permanent Record, published October 24th, 2019.
On September 6, 2020, it was announced that Oliver Stone had signed on to write and direct a biopic about Snowden based upon his memoir. The movie is titled Citizen X. The filming began in"
5,"### Human: how do birds that dive from the air into the water to catch fish manage to get back up into the air? wouldn't the water soaking their feathers weigh them down?

 ### Assistant: A bird is a warm-blooded vertebrate animal of the class Aves. Most species are winged, and fly using wings covered with feathers. Some flightless species have been adapted for swimming or running instead. Birds are endothermic animals (they keep themselves warm by generating heat in their bodies). All birds lay eggs and most hatch them after an incubation period lasting one to eight weeks. They have lightweight skeletons made mostly of hollow bones. The flesh on their skin has no fat under it. Their skulls contain large eyes and powerful beaks. Many also have talons on their feet used as weapons or tools. There were about 10,500 living species at the beginning of the twenty first century. Humans have domesticated some birds. These include chickens, turkeys, ducks, geese, pigeons, parrots, cockatoos, macaws, canaries, lovebirds, budgerigars, zebra finches, quails, ostriches, emus, cassowaries, peafowls, guinea fowl, doves, pheasants, partridges, grouse, and many others.
The largest order of birds is the Passeriformes which includes all perching songbirds, such as sparrows, warblers, and thrushes. It contains over half of all bird species. In fact there may be more than twice as many passerine species as nonpasserines. One way scientists identify these two groups is by looking at the shape of the palate inside their mouths. Nonpasserines have tubular tongues while passerines have flat ones. Another characteristic of passerines is the presence of seven cervical vertebrae. This means they can turn their heads almost upside down without breaking their necks. Other types of birds are waders, shorebirds, gulls, terns, auks, frigatebirds, boobies, pelicans, herons, egrets, storks, ibises, spoonbills, flamingoes, tropicbirds, cormorants, darters, grebes, sandpipers, albatrosses, petrels, shearwaters, storm-petrels, diving-petrels, and sw"
6,"### Human: decades ago, how were people able to get married in their 20's, have kids, afford a house, live/strive rather comfortably, and still have enough saved up to retire?
Not specific to U.S. neither. Even my home country now in Asia - bachelor's degree gets you lower wage jobs, enough for food/rent, but barely afford a car, and almost no hopes for a house. What's changed in the past decades? & nbsp; & nbsp; EDIT: This is depressing.
 ### Assistant: In the United States, it used to be that most young adults could marry by age 21-25 (the average age of marriage has been steadily increasing since then), have children before they are 30 years old, buy houses at a price which would not take more than half their income, and yet also save money for retirement. Nowadays, those same things may never happen until one reaches middle age or even later, if ever. How did this change come about? It was caused by many factors such as technology advancements like computers taking over manufacturing jobs from humans who need only high school education instead of college degrees anymore so there aren't nearly enough well paying blue collar positions left where someone can make enough money without having any formal training whatsoever beyond basic math skills needed on factory floors today while white collar workers with advanced degrees often earn much higher salaries because companies want them working long hours doing tedious tasks all day every week just so they don't lose out competitively against other businesses vying after similar talent pools around town too! The result being fewer opportunities available overall resulting from these changes happening gradually over time leading us here right now where we find ourselves living through an economic crisis unlike anything seen before during our lifetimes due largely in part thanks again mainly down technological advances made possible only recently when compared historically speaking...which brings me back full circle once again reminding myself why I started writing this post originally –because despite whatever problems exist currently within society right now there will always remain hope somewhere somehow someday soon hopefully sooner rather than later though maybe not necessarily tomorrow either way let alone next year but definitely eventually some point down road ahead unless otherwise stated explicitly otherwise indicated implicitly implied indirectly inferred presumed assumed conjectured estimated guessed thought hypothesized supposed speculated imagined surmised projected anticipated expected believed dreamed wished hoped prayed desired wanted envisioned visualized pictured conceived planned designed formulated fashioned shaped crafted built constructed created produced formed molded cast sculpted chiseled hammered cut drilled filed machined milled turned ground polished buffed honed planed sanded smoothened finished varnished painted lacquered coated glazed gilded silver plated gold plated chrome plated nickel plated bronze plated brass plated steel plated aluminum plated zinc plated tin pl"
7,"### Human: how do we lay internet cables at the bottom of the ocean?
I was under the impression that a huge majority of the world's oceans are unexplored... how do we lay cables across these vast areas? Do we only go places we've mapped? Or, is this work resulting in new areas being mapped? And how the hell does it happen? Sorry if this is a repost, I searched before asking.
 ### Assistant: Cable mapping or cable locating refers to techniques used by companies and governments to locate submarine telecommunications cables on the floor of the sea. It helps them avoid damaging existing cables when they put down their own cables for communication purposes. The method has been developed over time since 19th century with improved technology. In 2017, an estimated total length of about 350 million kilometers (about 218 million miles) of fiber-optic cables were laid around the globe, which makes up more than half of all transoceanic communications. This means there must be some way to find out where those cables are located so ships don’t run into them while sailing through international waters! There have even been cases where large cruise liners had accidentally hit one because nobody knew its exact location until after impact occurred - luckily no lives were lost but still…it could easily lead someone else getting hurt too due lack proper preparation prior event occurring. A company called SubCom specializes in finding these buried wires using sonar imagery from planes flying overhead as well other methods like satellites orbiting above Earth looking down below surface level towards bottom part our planet; however most often times people rely solely upon maps made years ago based off old data collected back then instead newer information gathered recently might show something different nowadays depending circumstances surrounding situation currently taking place right now here today moment present day future tomorrow next week month year decade century millennium era epoch age period generation span duration lifetime term lifespan life cycle existence span survival rate longevity tenure endurance continuance permanence immortality eternity perpetuity eternalness everlastingness abiding longstanding duration lasting persistence durability steadfastness sturdiness strength firmness toughness resilience hardiness fortitude grit determination resolution perseverance courage bravery valiance intrepidity boldness daring venturesomeness adventurous spirit enterprise initiative impetus drive ambition audacity fearlessness dauntlessness daredevilry rashness foolhardy recklessness heedlessness temerariousness impetuosity hotheadedness precipitate headstrong brashness ardor zest zeal enthusiasm eagerness keenness passion exuberance fervor verve vigor vim"
8,"### Human: why did we evolve to rely on sleep rather than being awake 24/7?
Might sound stupid... But it seems like it would be better considering you could be awake during the night to be alert and keep watch. I figure we would need some kind of rest but there are some species that can rest half of their brain while the other half still performs tasks.
 ### Assistant: Sleep is a state where our body relaxes, and our consciousness leaves us. It usually happens when people go unconscious at night time, or take drugs which make them fall asleep. The reason for this is not known yet. There have been many theories about why humans (and all animals) evolved to do this. Some say that if they were always awake, predators might get them; others think it may help with memory consolidation. One theory suggests that evolution favored those who slept less because they had more energy available throughout the day. Still another idea says that having regular periods of inactivity allows cells within an organism's nervous system to repair themselves from damage caused by overuse. This process helps prevent diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease later down life span! However no one really knows what causes us to want to sleep every now then so scientists will continue studying until someone finds out exactly how these things work inside your head -or maybe even outside too depending upon whether you believe genetics play any role here either way though since everything else does seem pretty clear cut already anyway.”
Theories include: 
Sleeping keeps predators away. If they woke up, they would become easy prey.
It protects against parasites. Parasites cause harmful effects during waking hours, and sleep gives time for immune systems to fight back.
Animals that live near water often spend most of their lives underwater, so there isn't much risk from predators while swimming around looking for food. These creatures tend to stay active longer into old age because they don't need as much rest between meals or mating seasons. Humans also benefit greatly from getting enough shuteye each night before going back home after working hard all week long at whatever job pays well enough so he doesn't starve himself sick trying feed his family members living nearby somewhere close enough where everyone feels safe walking alone late at night without fear being attacked by anyone lurking around waiting patiently just hoping catch sight unsuspecting victim strolling along darkened streets quietly minding own business peacefully drifting off dreamland blissful slumber unaware danger looming close behind ready pounce momentarily distracted gaze fixed elsewhere faraway place imaginary world full wonderment joy delight happiness contentment serenity tranquility calmness quietude repose ease relaxation leisure non"
9,"### Human: why women underperform men in every single sport, even those which do not require greater physical strenh (like the high dive).
I know that in most sports, men's greater average strenh and stamina factors in heavily. But I was watching video and got to wondering - why is the women's record 54 feet less than the men's? Are women selling themselves short, or is there something physiological going on here?
 ### Assistant: The high diving event at the Olympics will be held for the first time this year. It is a relatively new sport so far as the Olympics are concerned but it has been around since the late nineteenth century. In other words, the Olympic Games have missed out on one of the few sports where women can compete equally with men, if they wish to, and win medals. The only reason that this is true is because all the other events at the Olympics demand more strength from competitors. Women underperform men in every single sport, even those which do not require greater physical strenh (such as archery, javelin throwing and swimming). This means that male divers always perform better than female divers, whatever their level of skill. Men's bodies are simply stronger and tougher than women's bodies. At present, women cannot jump higher than 27 metres; men regularly reach heights of over 30 metres. A good example of how women diver badly behind men comes from the world championships held in Mexico City last month. The top three places were taken by Chinese men who had leapt between 19m and 20m. They beat the next best team by ten points. Their nearest rivals were British girls, whose highest score came from an amazingly brave 16-year-old girl called Sarah Barrow who scored just 80 points for her final dive. She needed nearly two hundred extra points to catch up with the winners! If she could ever manage to improve her performance by another twenty percent, then she would probably end up winning gold herself. What about the Russian team who finished fourth? Well, they lost out partly because their strongest member failed to make the final sixteen. Another man might well have won them second place. So what does all this mean? Firstly, it proves that we need to stop treating athletic contests like horse races. We should give each athlete marks according to his/her ability rather than comparing people against each other. Secondly, it shows us that sexism still exists in many areas of life. Although the IOC claims that gender equality is important, its attitude towards women's diving suggests otherwise. And thirdly, it demonstrates how much harder women have to work before they achieve parity with men. Even though men and women train hard, some jobs take longer to master. For instance, no woman has yet managed to throw a shot put further than si"
10,"### Human: why don't babies have wrinkly skin when they are born, considering they spend 9 months in fluids?

 ### Assistant: Wrinkles (also known as rhytides) are creases or folds on the skin. They usually occur because of a loss of elasticity and collagen that comes with age. It is also called ""crow’s feet"" or laugh lines if it occurs around eyes. The cause can be due to dehydration or smoking. Most people get wrinkled skin after their thirties. This is because over time, our bodies lose water content from aging and dryness. When we are younger, there is more fluid inside cells so they stay hydrated but as we grow older this changes which leads them becoming drier since less moisture enters into cell walls where proteins form cross-links between molecules creating structural integrity within tissues like muscle fibers for example - thus making us look old! A good way not only prevent these signs from appearing sooner than expected would involve drinking plenty amounts daily while eating healthy food choices such as fruits vegetables lean meats fish oils etc... Also avoiding sun exposure will help slow down any further damage caused by UV rays breaking down elastin/collagen proteins needed during youthful years leading up until now; instead opt outdoors activities whenever possible rather then spending too much indoors sitting under artificial light sources all day long without getting enough vitamin D through natural means outside world around yourself."" There are many ways one could go about trying reduce appearance wrinkle prone areas include applying topical treatments containing retinoid acid peptide serums exfoliants glycerine hyaluronic acids antioxidant extracts alpha hydroxy fruit enzymes etc.. If none seem effective enough try laser resurfacing chemical peels dermabrasion microdermabrasion cryotherapy IPL photorejuvenation radiofrequency microneedling ultrasound fractional RF devices Fractional CO2 ablative resurfacing erbium YAG NdYAG diode lasers intense pulsed light therapies LED red light infrared sauna sweat rooms steam baths facials massages etc… All methods work differently depending upon individual needs so consult professional advice beforehand prior starting any treatment regimen. But most important thing remember though no matter what technique used results won’t last forever eventually requiring maintenance sessions every few weeks month"
11,"### Human: why isn't there any passion from both democrats and republicans about making voting day a national holiday?

 ### Assistant: Voting Day is the date when an election happens. It can be on different dates, but it always takes place in November or December of each year. The first Tuesday after the 1st Monday of every month was chosen to make sure people have time for traveling. This is so that they could get back home before winter starts. In some states elections happen at other times than November because their weather conditions are not good enough during this period. People who do not vote lose all rights as citizens until they pay fines up to $500 dollars (in most cases). They also cannot run again unless two years pass since then. Most countries around world hold presidential elections once per four years while others may conduct them more often based upon local customs; however no one country has ever held its own general elections twice consecutively without changing anything else along with those changes too! Some countries such United States allow voters aged eighteen years old or older cast ballots whereas others require only twenty-one year old adults living within boundaries set forth by lawmakers themselves before being allowed into polls - these include Mexico where anyone over sixteen years old may participate regardless if he/she lives outside city limits provided he/she does not reside anywhere near military bases located close enough proximity wise speaking terms used here meaning ""close"" geographically speaking rather than socially speaking which would mean something totally different altogether depending upon contextual usage itself alone though generally speaking it refers specifically towards physical closeness between two points A & B respectively speaking terms used here meaning ""close"" physically speaking rather than emotionally speaking which would mean something completely different entirely altogether instead meaning something like friendship feelings shared mutually between friends etcetera alike kindred spirits united together under common bonds created through love affection admiration respect trust loyalty honor duty service dedication commitment devotion allegiance fealty fidelity faithfulness steadfastness constancy dependability reliability honesty integrity truthfulness sincerity veracity candor uprightness righteousness fair play sportsmanship equitableness impartiality objectivity neutrality justness justice evenhandedness balanced judgement temperance moderation self-control restraint reason prudence discretion discernment acumen sagacity shrewdness wit intelligence cleverness cunning craftiness guile artifice foxiness slyness wiles trickery deceit deception fraud cheating"
12,"### Human: can someone explain rocky horror picture show to me? i feel like i didn't ""get it""

 ### Assistant: The Rocky Horror Picture Show is a 1975 musical comedy movie. It was directed by Jim Sharman and stars Tim Curry, Susan Sarandon, Barry Bostwick, Richard O'Brien (who also wrote the music), Meat Loaf, and Patricia Quinn. This movie has been shown in midnight shows since its release because of how popular it became with people who went to see these movies at nighttime during that time period. The film is about two young lovers named Brad Majors and Janet Weiss who get caught up in an alien transvestite mad scientist Dr. Frank-N-Furter's world when they run out of gas on their way home from visiting relatives for Thanksgiving Day weekend! They end up being invited into his castle where he lives along with other characters such as Riff Raff (the butler) Magenta (maid). These three are all played by actors/actresses who were part of The Rocky Horror Show stage play before this version came out so there will be some similarities between them both even though one might not know what happened after watching just either production alone without seeing both together firsthand or reading reviews online etcetera.. If you want more information about any particular character then please check out our article below which covers each person individually including their background storyline within this universe too...
The cast includes Tim Curry as Dr. Frank N Furter; Susan Sarandon plays Janet Weiss while Brad Majors was portrayed by Barry Bostwick. Other roles include Meatloaf playing Eddie Adams/Dr. Everett von Scott; Patricia Quinn appeared as Magenta alongside Charles Gray playing the narrator role throughout most scenes except when she speaks directly towards camera lens herself (which happens rarely). In addition we have Jonathan Adams appearing briefly near beginning credits sequence singing 'Sweet Transvestite'. He later returns again briefly during final act scene where he sings duet alongside Tim Curry performing song called ""Hot Patootie - Bless My Soul"". Lastly we find Peter Hinwood starring opposite Christopher Malcolm & Hilary Labow respectively playing Rocky Horror Creature himself & Columbia respectively speaking only few words total throughout entire duration running length feature length motion picture here today.""

13,"### Human: why is there a blood shortage? hospitals charge like $800 per unit. why don't they pay $250 for a donation. everyone would donate. eli5

 ### Assistant: A blood shortage means that not enough people are giving their blood to the hospital system, and it needs more of it than it has available. There have been many reasons given by experts as to why this happens in the United States. The most common reason is because the supply does not meet demand. It costs money to get your blood drawn at a clinic or doctor’s office (about 10-40 US dollars). Many Americans cannot afford to give up time from work just so they can go through with something expensive like getting tested for HIV/AIDS every six months; however some places will waive fees if you bring someone else along who also wants an appointment but doesn't qualify under certain criteria such as being homeless etcetera... In addition, hospitals charge around $800 per unit which makes things even harder on those living below poverty level since they won't be able make ends meet without any extra income coming into play here either way around these types situations where individuals may find themselves unable due lack funds alone among other factors contributing towards overall health issues related directly back onto them personally speaking specifically regarding personal finances management practices associated thereto accordingly correspondingly proportionately respectively therefore consequently correlatively correspondentially congruously commensurably comparatively equitably equivalently equally proportionally reciprocally respectfully retrospectively retroactively reactively regressively reflexively reflectively regeneratively recuperatively recurrently recursively resiliently responsibly resurgingly retrievely restoratively revertedly revertingly returningly renewingly renegotiatingly remediatedly redistributively reinforcingly rectangularly repatriatedly reconstitutively recombinatorially reconstitutionally reconstructionally reconstructively reconditionedly reconfiguredly redirectedly redividedly reducedly reformulatedly regroupedly reliquishly relinquishedly removablely renovatedly reorganisedly restoredly restructuringly reversedly revitalizedly revolutionarily reviewedly rigidly rightly robbedly robustly royaltiedly ruddily ruminantly rumouredly runtedly runningly rupturedly sabbatically saccharineously sacramentally sacredly sacrificially salubriousness satirically scaredly scarredly schematically schedulewise schedulingly secularly selflessly senilely sentimental"
14,"### Human: how can people doubt huge moments in history, like the holocaust or men landing on the moon?
There are videos, photos, witnesses. How can people deny enormous events in history when wars have been accepted and (I'm just being complete curious with this one rather than to incite debate) believe bible stories, where miracles are just a norm?
 ### Assistant: The Holocaust was an event that happened during World War II when Adolf Hitler killed 6 million Jews. People who say it didn't happen is called Deniers of the Holocaust. They think that there were only about half as many deaths at most, not six million. Some even say it never happened at all! However, there are thousands of documents from Nazi Germany saying that they planned to kill millions of Jews. There are also pictures taken by German soldiers showing piles of dead bodies. Even some Germans admit what their government did. For example, after the war ended, some high-ranking officials admitted to killing Jewish people. Many other countries around the world know what happened because many survivors escaped to those places. A lot of them live today. Their grandchildren tell everyone what happened to them and their family members. Also, many Jews still go back to visit the concentration camps every year so they will always remember what happened. When someone says ""the Holocaust never happened"", people get very upset and sad. This is because it reminds them of terrible things happening again. It could be possible if nobody stopped these bad things from happening again though. That would make everyone feel scared for themselves too since no one knows when something similar might start up once more unless we learn our lessons well enough now before anything else happens later down the line... In addition, historians agree that genocide does exist within human nature - meaning humans naturally tend towards violence against each other based solely upon differences such as religion/race etc., which leads us into discussing why certain groups target others specifically instead of just anyone else nearby due simply out racism alone without any real reason behind it besides prejudice itself..

15,"### Human: Why are ancient seers and oracles portrayed as being deformed in historical fiction?
I've noticed in that seers and oracles are often portrayed having some kind of deformity, like in Vikings, The 300, even Greek mythology with the Stygian witches. Is there any historical evidence to back this up or reason why they are portrayed this way?
 ### Assistant: In many works of historical fiction, seers (people who can see into the future) and oracles (who tell people what will happen in the future) are depicted as being deformed in some manner. This is because historically, these roles were filled by women who had a disability which would make them look different from other women at the time. A lot of times it was believed that their disabilities gave them special powers. These days, though, we know that most disabilities do not have anything to do with supernatural abilities. However, people still think about how disabled people used to be treated differently than non-disabled people. They also sometimes use characters with disabilities to show what life might have been like for those people during certain points in history. Ancient Greeks thought that blindness meant someone could talk to gods better than others could hear them. People today don’t believe that anymore but they still remember when they did so much more easily if you showed them something visually instead of verbally explaining things! There may also be other reasons why an author writes about seers/oracles as being physically deformed such as trying to create drama between two main characters where one has physical strength while another doesn’t seem able enough due either through age or ill health; however this does depend upon whether its set within medieval times before modern medicine existed yet still shows signs towards advancement over centuries ago beforehand too.. It all comes down really just personal preference I guess... :) But anyway - here goes nothing!! So let us start off talking about why exactly does anyone care about ancient cultures anyway?? Well firstly because there aren't many left nowadays since technology changes everything faster than ever imagined possible . Secondly because understanding our past helps understand ourselves better today , especially when considering cultural differences between societies worldwide ; lastly because studying human behaviour gives insight into how humans work generally speaking , including learning new skills along the way ! All these factors combined together help shape who each individual person becomes throughout lifetime experiences gained through living on earth itself :). Hopefully after reading my post above maybe u got inspired enough yourself ? If yes then please leave feedback below telling me what u liked best outta whole thing ;) Happy Reading !! xoxo"
16,"### Human: can someone explain rocky horror picture show to me? i feel like i didn't ""get it""

 ### Assistant: The Rocky Horror Picture Show is a 1975 musical comedy movie. It was written by Richard O’Brien, who also wrote the music and lyrics for the stage play on which it was based. Jim Sharman directed the film version of the show. Tim Curry plays Dr Frank N Furter (the cross-dressing mad scientist) in both versions of the show. Susan Sarandon played Janet Weiss, Barry Bostwick played Brad Majors and Meat Loaf played Eddie. In this story, two young people have car trouble and go into an old castle where they meet strange characters including a transvestite mad doctor named Frank 'n' Furter. They then become involved with the creatures he has created. This includes a handsome man made entirely out of meat called Rocky. After several adventures, the couple return home safely, but are changed forever. There were songs such as “Sweet Transvestite”, “Hot Patootie – Bless My Soul” and “Time Warp”. These are still popular today. Many fans dress up at midnight screenings of the movie. It had been released many times since its original release date. A special edition DVD was released in 2004. People often do not understand what happened because there are so many jokes and references that you need to know beforehand. But if you enjoy watching things more than once or twice, you will probably be able to follow along better each time after that first viewing. Most people think it is very funny even though some parts may seem confusing without knowing anything about them ahead of time. If you want your children to see this movie, make sure they are mature enough to handle sexual situations between adults (and aliens). Also, keep in mind that language used here might offend sensitive ears! You should check out all other movies listed under this category too; there are lots available online nowadays thanks to Netflix streaming service offering thousands upon thousands different titles from every genre imaginable including classic films right alongside new releases straight from Hollywood studios themselves!. So take advantage while they last long enough until another company decides whether or not we deserve access again soon enough...

17,"### Human: Were entire villages in Europe deserted during the Black Death? If so, what became of them?
I've heard it said that entire villages were wiped out but I never knew if it was true. What happened to the towns? Were they just left alone until it was all over? Were they sacked?
 ### Assistant: The Black Death is a plague which killed many people between 1347 and 1350 AD. It spread through trade routes across Asia and Africa before reaching Europe in October 1347. There are records from this time showing whole villages being abandoned as their inhabitants died. Afterwards the land would be used for farming or grazing animals again. Many places have names like ""Death Town"" (Town where everyone died) or similar because of these events. Some examples include ""Plague Street"", ""Black Death Lane"", ""The Plague Village"". In England there is even an area called ""Deadman's Corner"". This may refer to one such village where most of its population had died due to disease caused by bacteria Yersinia pestis which causes bubonic plague. As well as causing death among humans; rats also suffered greatly at times with upwards of half dying within weeks after exposure to fleas carrying Yersina Pestis virus particles into human bloodstreams via bites received while feeding off dead rodents infected earlier on either side of Atlantic Ocean shorelines along North America coastline stretching southward towards Mexico Gulf Coast region including Florida peninsula territory known today simply “Florida” meaning flowerbed referring originally back when Spanish conquistadors first arrived here centuries ago seeking riches beyond imagination only find themselves surrounded unexpectedly large number native tribesmen armed spears shields ready fight anyone dared trespass onto sacred ground belonging tribe members living nearby community center located deep jungle interior somewhere near present day Miami metropolitan area boundary lines established early twentieth century period following end World War II era global conflict involving several nations vying control certain territories worldwide based ideologies belief systems religious affiliations political leanings etcetera...
In France, about 20% of the population died, while in Germany it reached almost 60%. Most European cities lost more than two thirds of their population. In total, the Black Death killed around 8 million people throughout Europe. One town, Eyam in Derbyshire, quarantined itself. All who lived in Eyam died, but no one else did.
There are still some ruined medieval villages in Britain and Ireland. These are sometimes thought to have been deserted during the Black Death, although other explanations exist. For example, some settlements might have been destroyed during wars fought long before then"

The upper graph shows populations vs. year and the lower graph shows the relative growth. I was wondering what was causing the hump at 400 b.c. in the lower graph.

19,"### Human: Before the light bulb (and after, but before high-powered bulbs), did trains travel only by day? If they traveled at night, what are the details of what happened if an animal or debris was on the tracks?
If they did travel at night, was that limited to cargo only, or did passenger trains travel by night as well? Did they use oil lamps in the compartments? Was there a high risk of fires?
 ### Assistant: Trains used to travel mainly during the day. This was because it was easier for workers to see where they were going and to avoid collisions with animals on the track. There were also fewer accidents than when trains ran at night. In 1853, John Tyndall invented a new type of headlamp which could be seen from far away. It became popular very quickly. The first electric lights came along later, but they needed a lot of power so most people still went back to using gaslights instead. Higher-powered bulbs would come later. Some places had trolley cars running underneath them with wires strung across streets above their heads. These gave off enough light for drivers who didn't want any extra work while driving at night! But this meant passengers couldn’t enjoy reading books inside since no one else could see through windows unless you turned your own lamp onto yourself too – not ideal conditions either way really… At least until someone figured out how make better ones eventually though.. . So nowadays we have much brighter versions available today thanks advancements made over time such as LED technology being able produce more lumens per unit area compared older incandescent models which weren't nearly efficient enough due lacking proper shielding against heat buildup caused burning out filaments prematurely leading shorter lifespans overall resulting lower performance levels outputted from these devices accordingly...

20,"### Human: how did che guevara become a symbol for freedom despite his terrible actions?

 ### Assistant: Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara (June 14, 1928 – October 9, 1967) was an Argentine revolutionary and politician. He is often seen as the most famous person in Cuba since Fidel Castro. The United States called him a terrorist because he helped Castro take over Cuba by force. Many people think that Che was only good at fighting but bad at governing. But many others still see him as a hero who died trying to help poor countries like Cuba. They say he gave up everything so they could have more power than before. Because of this, some companies use his image on their products even though it's against what he believed in while alive. This makes them money which then goes back into making more merchandise with his face or name printed all across it; however, these items are usually not very high quality because they were made cheaply just to make money off of someone else’s legacy instead of actually caring about helping those less fortunate than themselves. In addition, there has been much controversy surrounding whether or not wearing clothes featuring images related to Che helps spread communism around the world. Some believe that doing so does nothing except support capitalism through consumerism while others argue otherwise claiming such clothing lines promote social justice movements rather than oppressive regimes where workers suffer under authoritarian rule. Still other viewpoints exist within this debate including one group saying its okay if you wear t-shirts depicting either side depending upon your personal opinion without being forced into any specific ideology regardless of political affiliation. No matter what anyone thinks about these topics though, there will always be disagreement among individuals until everyone agrees unanimously. However unlikely this may seem given human nature, I hope someday soon enough when everybody understands each other better things might change accordingly."" - anonymous source
Despite his horrible acts, he became a symbol of freedom because of his death. When he was captured and killed, he had no chance to tell anybody anything. People thought that if he spoke out, nobody would listen. So, now he stands for something different from what he wanted originally. It can also mean that people should speak up whenever possible, especially when faced with difficult situations. If somebody wants to stop talking, don't let them! Keep going until you get heard--even if it takes years or decades later...or never happens at all. Don"
21,"### Human: what causes sociopathy?
Also, how do you recognize it in a person? EDIT: Thank you for all the informative responses Although this was more of an academic query, people have said that I may have sociopathic tendencies so I wanted to learn more about it :P Again, thanks everyone
 ### Assistant: Sociopathy is also called antisocial personality disorder. It is when someone has no empathy and does not feel guilty about their actions even if they hurt other people or animals. They are often violent criminals who cannot be rehabilitated by prison because there is nothing wrong with them; they just don't care about anyone else except themselves. People can become sociopaths due to abuse as children (such as being neglected) but most cases come from genetics where one parent had the gene for it which passed down through generations until now we see many offspring born with these traits like lacking remorse after hurting others etc... There isn't much known about why some people develop into becoming sociopaths while others stay normal throughout life though scientists believe its possible since certain brain areas seem different between those two groups compared against each other . 
In order for someone diagnosed with ASPD(antisocial personality disorder), he/she must meet at least three criteria listed below before getting classified under this label: 1) failure towards social norms- meaning laws broken repeatedly without regard such as stealing cars despite knowing better than doing so 2.) aggression directed towards others including physical violence against another human being 3.) lack of guilt regarding any action taken on behalf himself/herself regardless whether harm occurred during process leading up until completion point where victim suffers consequences associated directly related event itself."" The DSM IV TR diagnostic manual lists symptoms required before making official determination based upon meeting minimum threshold requirements set forth above mentioned section titled ""Sociopathy"". Someone might exhibit behaviors similar but still fall short enough points needed because they only show signs occasionally instead consistently over long period time frame whereas typical patient would demonstrate these characteristics regularly day-to-day basis without interruption unless something major happened causing temporary lapse judgment resulting short term memory loss thus forgetting rules governing society's expectations. This means every single thing done outside boundaries established law enforcement officials deem acceptable behavior according American culture standards today. These include lying cheating stealing drugs alcohol use gambling prostitution pornography viewing indecent exposure acts vandalism property damage assault battery robbery rape murder arson burglary fraud forgery counterfeiting tax evasion perjury bribery extortion money laundering smuggling conspi"
22,"### Human: why are chinese and japanese people called ""asians"", but indians aren't?

 ### Assistant: In the United States, Chinese and Japanese people are usually considered to be Asian. However, Indian (from India) people are not always thought of as Asians. This is because they look different than East-Asian or Southeast-Asian people do. Also, most Indians speak Indo-Aryan languages like Hindi which are not related to any other language spoken in Asia except for Dravidian languages such as Tamil and Telugu. It can also be said that when Americans say ""I am Asian"" it means he/she is from South Asia. So technically speaking an American born in America with parents who immigrated here would call themselves European if their ancestors came over on boats during colonial times while someone else might refer to themselfs as Native American depending upon what part of North America they live near where there were many tribes living at one time before Europeans arrived . The term ""Native American"" refers only those groups whose original homeland was within present day boundaries defined by treaties signed between nations after 1803; otherwise all others have been classified under ""American"". There has never been a country called ""India,"" so nobody knows how these words became associated together until recently when some people started using this phrase more often than ever before! Some countries use both terms interchangeably even though one may mean something entirely different than another does – especially since English isn’t necessarily used everywhere around worldwide either way…so don’t worry too much about whether you should call yourself “Asian” or not based solely off your ethnic background alone–it really doesn’t matter unless you want everyone thinking differently about what type person YOU actually are instead of just assuming things without knowing anything else first hand!! Just remember that no matter how much we try hard enough sometimes life throws curveballs anyway..and sometimes those curves come back around full circle eventually too..but hopefully not right away lol ;)
The word 'Asian' is derived from the Latin name for Asia, namely Asiana. But why are chinese and japanese people called ""asians"", but indians aren't?. The reason behind this question is quite simple - China and Japan were colonized by Western powers long ago whereas India remained independent throughout its history up till nowadays. Because of this difference in cultural heritage, they have developed into two distinct cultures with unique characteristics respectively known today as Eastern culture and Oriental civilization. These two concepts cannot"
23,"### Human: why american sport teams expect that the public should pay for their stadiums.

 ### Assistant: A sports venue is a place where people go to watch an athletic event, such as football or baseball games. It can also be used in other ways. In many cities and countries around the world, there are places built specifically for these events called sports arenas. The most famous of these include Wrigley Field (Chicago), Madison Square Garden (New York City) and Fenway Park (Boston). These buildings have been home to some of America's greatest moments; from Joe DiMaggio hitting his 56th homerun at Yankee Stadium on September 23rd, 1947 all way through Michael Jordan scoring 69 points against Larry Bird & Co.'s Boston Celtics during Game Six of their NBA Finals series which ended with Chicago winning its third straight championship title after being down three games earlier in June 1980! Other examples include Staples Center located downtown Los Angeles CA USA where Lakers play basketball every year since opening day back when Shaquille O’Neal was still playing alongside Kobe Bryant before leaving town due too contract dispute between him/his agent Jerry Buss who owned both teams respectively – now known today simply ""Lakerland"". But don't forget about Oracle Arena either because Golden State Warriors call it home court advantage whenever they host opponents within bay area region including Oakland Raiders NFL team members whom reside across San Francisco Bay Bridge connecting two major metropolitan areas together under one roof known locally referred affectionately nicknamed 'The House That Magic Built'.
Whenever American professional sports teams want new facilities, they usually ask local taxpayers to help them build those facilities by raising money through bonds sold by governments (or sometimes private companies). This means that if you live near one of these stadiums then your property value will probably increase over time because more tourists come into town thanks to having something like this here instead of just having nothing but empty space around where nobody wants anything done anymore except maybe fixing up old houses so no one else has any trouble living next door while waiting patiently until someone buys out entire neighborhood blocks worth millions dollars each month without fail ever again...because we already did our part helping make sure everything runs smoothly once upon a time long ago far away land somewhere else entirely different place altogether unrelated somehow related anyway I guess?
Why do American sport teams think that the public should pay for their stadiums? They say it would bring jobs"
24,"### Human: Did the Union consider charging, trying, and executing Robert E. Lee or Jefferson Davis after the former's surrender at Appomattox? Relatedly, how did Lee hope the South would reintegrate?
In honor of the 150th anniversary of Lee's surrender, I was thinking about the intended and unintended consequences of Appomattox. Apparently some of Lincoln's councilors charging Davis, but ultimately decided it would cause more unrest than it would avoid. Is that accurate? How exactly did Union leadership react to the surrender? And simultaneously, what was Lee's life like after Appomattox? An entry in the Times's blog, ""Disunion,"" suggests Lee wanted a with the Union, but his lieutenants, instead, fostered the ""Lost Cause"" myth that gave/continues to give us so much trouble today. Is there any merit to that claim?
 ### Assistant: The United States considered charging Confederate General Robert E. Lee with treason after he surrendered at Appomattox on April 9, 1865. They also thought about doing this for President Jefferson Davis as well. However, they chose not to do either because they felt that if they charged them with anything, it might lead to another Civil War. It is said that Abraham Lincoln wanted to have both men executed, but others talked him out of it. He let both go free. As far as Lee goes, though, he had been given an amnesty by Grant beforehand anyway (Grant knew Lee personally). This meant that no matter who won, neither side could charge the other with crimes. A few days later, Davis escaped from Richmond just before it fell to Union forces. After being captured, he spent two years in prison until he was released. Both were pardoned by Andrew Johnson shortly afterward. In June 1867, Congress passed legislation allowing people who fought against the Union during the war to be able to hold office again. Even though many Southerners tried to blame Lee for losing the war, he became very popular among white Americans in the South once Reconstruction ended. Most whites saw him as a hero who stood up for their rights when everyone else turned against them. His home state of Virginia honored him often, including naming several cities after him. Today, most historians agree that while he may have made mistakes along the way, Lee was one of America’s greatest generals ever. When asked why he didn’t try harder to win battles earlier in order to save lives overall, he replied “It has always seemed strange to me that men should want to kill each other.” At times during the war, especially near its end, he hoped that black slaves would be freed permanently. But he never went around saying such things publicly; even his own wife found out only after she died! Still, despite these differences between himself and other leaders within his army (like Stonewall Jackson), Lee remained loyal throughout almost all four long years until finally giving up completely right before Christmas Day 1864 – which marked yet another turning point towards victory for those fighting under Ulysses S. Grant’s command across Tennessee lines. Many believe that without Lee leading them into battle against Federal troops stationed nearby Fort Sumter back then too soon afterwards…well we wouldn’t know what happened next now would we? We"
25,"### Human: Why was Denazification (and the equivalent in Japan) so successful?
The ideological transformation of Germany and Japan seems to have been so quick, painless, and complete -- but seventy years later, the idea that you could impose liberal democratic institutions via military occupation seems absurdly naive. Why was there no meaningful fascist (or at least nationalist, or anti-occupation) insurgency in either country? How did the Allies convince the German and Japanese people to repudiate the ideology that had inspired such fanatical zeal during the war?
 ### Assistant: The process by which the victorious Allied powers changed the beliefs and attitudes of their enemies after World War II is called denazification (in Germany) or dekasakura (in Japan). It succeeded because it used both coercive measures and persuasion. Coercion 
Many Germans were tried for crimes against humanity; some were executed. Those who were not put on trial lived under strict supervision from Allied authorities. In addition, many Germans lost property through reparations payments made to other countries they invaded. All these factors helped make a new generation with different values than those of their parents.
Persuasion 
Allied propaganda programs taught the German population about how the Nazi Party came into power, what its goals were, and why it should be rejected. American soldiers also distributed copies of Hitler's Mein Kampf and other books to help educate them. These efforts showed the German people that the regime responsible for all this suffering wasn't actually good for them.
Today we think of denazification as something done only to Germany, but similar things happened elsewhere too. For example, in Italy Mussolini's Fascists were defeated by partisans before foreign troops arrived. Afterwards they faced trials just like Germany's Nuremberg Trials. Other European nations saw similar processes take place within their borders as well. Even though each nation handled it differently based on local circumstances, every one of them eventually became more peaceful societies where citizens now enjoy greater freedom than ever before!
In Japan, Emperor Hirohito announced his surrender over radio broadcasting system (which included China). He said ""the war situation has developed not necessarily to our advantage"", then added ""I cannot bear to see my innocent subjects suffer any longer"". This announcement shocked most Japanese civilians since he never mentioned anything about defeat or surrender until then. Many believed him when he promised better times ahead if they obeyed orders from occupying forces - including taking down statues honouring former leaders such as Tojo Hideki or Kim Gu. However, despite initial support among some segments of society, opposition grew quickly due to food shortages caused by blockades imposed upon Japan by America & Britain starting early 1945; along with lack of leadership after losing emperor figurehead status. A few months later General Douglas MacArthur declared martial law across entire archip"

Almay makes a foundation called ""smart shade"" that is supposed to magically change to match your skin tone. It comes out of the tube looking white with little black specks in it, but as you rub it into your skin, it turns to a fleshy colour. What kind of sorcery is this? Help me /r/AskScience!
 ### Assistant: Almay's Smart Shades are made from titanium dioxide and iron oxides which reflect light. The black particles absorb UV rays so they won't damage your skin. They also help keep the product on longer by making sure it sticks better. When applied to human skin, these pigments can only be seen if there's enough sunlight coming through them for their color to show up against our own natural complexion underneath - otherwise we just look like normal people who wear make-up sometimes instead of someone special because nobody knows what they really look like without any extra stuff put onto their faces first before going outside where everyone else sees us too...

27,"### Human: how can roman bridges be still standing after 2000 years, but my 10 year old concrete driveway is cracking?

 ### Assistant: Roman architecture was very different from modern building. They used materials that are not often found in the modern world. For example, they did not use cement or mortar to hold their stones together. This means that many of their buildings have survived for thousands of years without falling apart. However, it also means that most new construction cannot last as long. A good example would be a bridge built by the Romans about 2000 years ago. It has stood up well over all those centuries. On the other hand, your 10-year-old concrete driveway may already need repairs because cracks are appearing on its surface. In fact, if you look at any large structure made out of stone (like churches), there will always be some kind damage such as chips or holes due to wear and tear caused by weather conditions like rain eroding away at it slowly over time until eventually nothing remains except dust particles left behind after everything else has crumbled down into small pieces which then get blown around everywhere creating more problems than before when we started off with just one piece intact! Concrete does not last nearly so long - usually only about 50 years before needing major maintenance work done again; whereas limestone could easily stand up against harsh elements for hundreds upon hundreds maybe even thousands depending upon where exactly these structures were constructed within our planet's atmosphere itself.""
The reason why this type of material doesn’t last forever comes down primarily two factors – moisture content inside walls/ceilings plus temperature fluctuations outside causing expansion contraction cycles throughout entirety structural system resulting frequent stress fractures leading eventual failure under heavy loads placed onto them during normal usage scenarios every day life activities conducted inside home environment spaces occupied people living here now present moment future generations yet come pass once again sometime soon enough hopefully sooner rather later though probably never know unless happen witness firsthand yourself personally experienced situation directly involved parties concerned affected area surrounding vicinity near proximity close range distance viewpoint perspective point reference frame comparison purposes sake argument debate discussion purposes solely entertainment pleasure amusement reasons alone enjoyable experience overall benefit everyone involved somehow way shape form fashion whatever manner possible best interest common good general welfare public safety security protection peace order harmony balance stability etcetera et al ad infinitum nauseam…..

28,"### Human: Why do honeybees have barbed stingers that allow them only one sting?
Wouldn't it be more advantageous to be able to sting multiple times like wasps and hornets? It seems like dying after one sting seems inefficient in defending a hive, since you're down a worker even if your hive survives.
 ### Assistant: Honeybees are not aggressive by nature but they will defend their nest when threatened. They can give painful stings with the use of their barbed stinger which is found at the end of the abdomen. The stinger has a poison sac attached to it and this causes anaphylactic shock. This means that the person who gets stung may go into cardiac arrest or die from asphyxiation (not being able to breathe). A single sting usually kills the honeybee because its body splits open while trying to pull out the stinger. If the stinger breaks off inside the victim, the venom continues to pump into the wound until the stinger is removed. When people get too many stings, there can be fatalities.  Most other insects with stingers can sting repeatedly without harming themselves. Only female honeybees possess a stinger; males and young workers lack this structure and cannot sting. For this reason, male honeybees are sometimes called drones. In some species, such as the bumblebee, all members of the colony can sting. However, most females and males do so rarely, preferring instead to avoid conflict unless absolutely necessary. Even then, they try to escape rather than fight. Worker bees generally don’t leave the hive except for short periods to collect pollen and nectar for food. Sometimes, however, they fly away in search of new homes when overcrowding occurs within the hive due to an increase in population size during warmer months when flowers bloom abundantly. These flights often take place at night when temperatures drop below freezing point enabling them to conserve energy by staying warm near each other while flying towards another suitable site where they hope to build nests. After finding such places, these scouts return home carrying information about what kind of building materials would suit best before leading others back there again later on. Once established inside newly built structures made up mostly from wood pulp fibres mixed together using saliva secreted through special glands located beneath tongue tips belonging exclusively among social insects including termites whose diet consists mainly consisting solely carbohydrates derived directly from plants via photosynthesis process performed primarily by leaves containing chlorophyll molecules responsible creating oxygen gas needed sustain life forms living around globe today including humans who depend heavily"
29,"### Human: why does everyone hate the sound of their own recorded voice?
I've heard that because our voice resonates in our head, we sound different to ourselves than to others, but our recorded voice is how we really sound. Is this accurate? Can someone give me a better explanation?
 ### Assistant: Most people find it hard to listen to recordings of themselves talking (sometimes called ""playback""). This can be very distressing for some people and may cause them to become embarrassed or even depressed. It has been suggested by psychologists such as George Behnke that the reason behind these feelings might lie with what he calls an 'acoustic mirror'. He suggests that when you speak your vocal cords vibrate inside your mouth which makes sounds that are reflected back at you from things like teeth, lips, tongue etc. The brain interprets those reflections so that they seem to come from somewhere else - usually about 50 cm away from where you actually are standing while speaking. So if I were to talk into my phone then I would hear myself coming out through its speaker(s). But since most phones only have one small hole on each side then there will always be some echo effect caused by having two sources close together; one being yourself and another person who might also want to communicate with us over long distances using similar devices without interfering too much between them!
This means that when we hear ourselves talk through microphones placed near enough together so that both sides produce sound waves simultaneously (which could happen if someone held up his hand next to mine), then all those reflected sounds bounce off each other until eventually reaching our ears again after passing through many layers within ourselves including skin cells & hair follicles etc., resulting in what appears like hearing oneself instead of someone else nearby listening carefully enough not get confused between voices due either distance difference between speakers/listeners OR lack proper understanding about how acoustics work properly before making any conclusions based upon assumptions made during conversation sessions involving multiple participants wherein conversations take place simultaneously amongst various groups scattered around globe Earthly surface area covered underneath oceans land masses continents islands countries cities towns villages hamlets settlements colonies military bases research stations hospitals schools universities prisons jails factories warehouses shopping malls airports railway stations bus terminals taxi stands parks stadiums concert halls churches temples mosques synagogues gurdwaras mandirs dharmashalas kovils kandashrams shrivenis namgharam satsangs sabhas sadhus yogis swamijis rishikumars acharya mahatmas pandits priests monks nuns lama rinpoches rinjung"
30,"### Human: why do blacksmiths use tungsten inert gas to weld?
I've been watching a lot of blacksmith videos on Youtube, like ""Man at Arms."" They use a TIG welder to weld, but am I misunderstanding what inert means? Shouldn't it be unable to burn since it's chemically inactive?
 ### Assistant: The name is actually an acronym. It stands for Tungsten Inert Gas (welding). This type of arc welder uses electricity and heat from the arc between the electrode and the base metal to melt both metals together. But unlike other types of arc welders that can use any fuel, this one must use pure argon or helium as its shielding gas. Pure nitrogen will work too, but only if there are not many impurities in the air where you are working. If there are lots of impurities such as oxygen, carbon dioxide, etc., then they may react with the molten metal causing porosity which weakens your joint. Also, when using pure nitrogen sometimes tiny bubbles form inside your weld pool because water vapor gets into it somehow while cooling down after being heated up by electric arcs; these small bubbles make cracks later when cooled completely so it's best not to take chances here either way! That said though some people have had success using regular old shop compressor air instead just fine - especially those who live near mountains where cold temperatures help keep moisture levels low enough outside their homes/workshops without needing expensive equipment just yet anyway...

Tungsten electrodes used for GTAW produces high temperature due to friction between them & base material ,which causes evaporation of surface layer forming protective oxides over itself .These oxides act as barrier against further reaction between atmosphere & hot metal .So no oxygen present around workpiece helps in producing strong bonds within structure making welded piece stronger than parent material .However excess presence of nitrogen leads towards formation of Nitrides leading towards brittle fractures upon impact testing .Hence care should taken while choosing proper filler wire according requirement otherwise defects might occur during post treatment processes like grinding /machining operations resulting poor quality product outputted finally !!!

31,"### Human: why is it that as we get older, we are able to handle eating hotter foods

 ### Assistant: As we age, our taste buds change. This means that when people eat something spicy or sour, they may not be able to tell the difference between a mild and strong flavor. Someone who has never tasted anything spicy before will probably find a jalapeño pepper very unpleasant; but someone who grew up in Mexico would have no problem with them at all because of their tolerance for spiciness over time. The same goes for other things such as coffee which can vary from person-to-person depending on how much caffeine was consumed during childhood years (and even adult life). People also tend to become less sensitive towards certain smells like perfume after being exposed too many times throughout adulthood so this could explain why some women prefer stronger scents while others do not enjoy them at all! 
As children grow older, they develop an immunity against different types of bacteria found in dirt that cause disease such as pneumonia or meningitis if left untreated. It takes about three weeks until one’s body learns how best defend itself against these harmful microorganisms by producing antibodies which fight off any future infections caused by them later down the road without needing medication anymore since you've already built up resistance due your exposure earlier than usual which makes sense considering most kids spend more time outdoors playing outside versus staying inside where there isn't enough sunlight coming through windows/doors etcetera so naturally they'll end up getting sick often unless treated immediately afterwards otherwise risk dying young due lack proper nutrition intake along side regular exercise routine plus good hygiene practices everyday life style choices made decisions based upon circumstances beyond control .

32,"### Human: why do people on online communities help out so much, what is the incentive?
I have used many helpful forums and such, and I never understood why people try so hard to be helpful and accurate, especially when there's no incentive. You're not in a group of friends, so you cant say you're helping out your friend, or that you gain the reputation of a smart guy.
 ### Assistant: People are often kind and helpful because they want others to treat them well too. They may also like feeling good about themselves by being nice and doing things for other people. The only reason most people would give up their time to answer questions is if it makes them feel better than before. Someone who helps out might get praise from others but this isn't always true - sometimes no one will notice at all! Sometimes someone will ask an easy question just so he can see how fast someone else answers it. This person won’t care whether his own response takes longer; instead, he wants to know which person gave him more information quickly enough without making mistakes along with way (so long as those mistakes aren't serious). When answering difficult questions, however, everyone tries harder because nobody likes looking stupid in front of strangers. There are different reasons why people respond differently depending upon where they live and work etcetera... For example, some cultures value politeness while others don’t think twice before telling off anyone who asks something silly.” In general though, we should expect everyone to act fairly nicely towards us unless otherwise stated explicitly via body language or verbal cues given during conversation."" We must remember that even if our intentions were pure when asking certain types/kinds/categories/genres etc., then chances are high enough that another person could misinterpret those same words due either directly through misunderstanding OR indirectly through prejudice against whomever said them originally – both scenarios leading potentially towards unpleasant situations later down line…” So yes indeed--it pays dividends NOT TO BE NICE ALL THE TIME!!! But sometimes life throws curveballs at ya anyway :-(."
33,"### Human: why is modern day camouflage pixelated?

 ### Assistant: Modern day camouflage has a lot of pixels in it. This was first used by the United States Army and later adopted for other armies around the world, like the British Armed Forces or German Bundeswehr. The reason for this pattern is that it breaks up an outline and makes things harder to see. A good example would be seeing something from far away with binoculars. It's hard to make out what you are looking at because your brain can only focus on one thing at once. When you use binoculars, however, all those little dots come together into shapes which help us recognize them better than if we were just using our eyes alone. So when soldiers wear their uniforms while fighting against enemies who might have similar clothing colors (like green), then these tiny spots will break up any possible patterns so as not give themselves away too easily! 
The same goes for animals such as zebras; they also use this type of ""camouflaging"" technique because predators often hunt based off sight rather than smell due mostly towards how much prey there happens to be available within range at any given time during hunting season...and even though some species may seem more obvious than others depending upon where they live--such as lions living near watering holes versus leopards found closer towards mountainside areas -all still need protection against potential threats coming after them whether its humans trying take advantage opportunities presented beforehand OR another animal wanting food sources nearby.""
 
In World War I, both sides tried different types of camo but none worked very well until the Germans came up with a new idea called 'Dazzle'. Dazzle was painted onto ships so that enemy submarines couldn’t tell what direction they were going in order to avoid being hit by torpedos fired from below sea level positions above surface waters without detection until too late since there wasn't enough warning time left between launches/fires etc., thus saving lives & equipment alike . However ,it did not last long either way due to lack of effectiveness compared against newer methods developed over years past including radar technology advancements made post WWI era leading up towards present date(2019). As mentioned earlier about how important visual cues play role whenever involved military operations abroad-same applies here today too!""

34,"### Human: decades ago, how were people able to get married in their 20's, have kids, afford a house, live/strive rather comfortably, and still have enough saved up to retire?
Not specific to U.S. neither. Even my home country now in Asia - bachelor's degree gets you lower wage jobs, enough for food/rent, but barely afford a car, and almost no hopes for a house. What's changed in the past decades? & nbsp; & nbsp; EDIT: This is depressing.
 ### Assistant: In the United States (and probably other countries as well), many young adults are not getting married until they are over thirty years old or even older than that. People used to be able to marry at about twenty-one years of age and then would begin having children by around twenty-five. They could also afford homes with ease because housing costs weren’t nearly what they are today. However, this has been changing over time since about the middle of the twentieth century when it became more commonplace for women to work outside of the home. It was only after World War II ended that most men returned from serving abroad which caused an increase in demand for workers who had been drafted into military service during war times before being discharged afterwards so there wasn’t much need anymore except maybe some specialized skills like engineering where college graduates might find themselves employed if lucky enough! But these days things seem different again because we see fewer couples tying knots early on compared to previous generations due mainly because society doesn’t value marriage as highly anymore while also making divorce easier too – all contributing factors leading towards later marriages overall among Americans especially those belonging within certain demographics such as minorities living below poverty line levels…

35,"### Human: why do we trust data in research papers and studies to not be manipulated
I have always trusted the data (not the conclusion) in any research paper I read mostly because everyone I know does that too. But why do we trust the scientific community so much with not manipulating the data? I can imagine in a lot of situations they might want false results to come out form the research. EDIT: corrected typo EDIT 2: Thanks everyone that really helped to clear up everything for me!
 ### Assistant: Whenever you look at an experiment or study, there are two main things you need to consider when deciding whether it is good science: The methods used by the scientists to collect their information and the conclusions which they draw from this information. Scientific knowledge comes from experiments and observations, and these must follow certain rules if they are going to be useful. These rules are called ""the scientific method"". If someone breaks one of these rules, then what they say may no longer be true. They could make mistakes on purpose (""falsify"" the evidence), but more often people just don't realize how important each rule is. This means that most errors in scientific work happen unintentionally; however, as long as every step has been followed correctly, you should still believe the result even though there was some mistake along the way somewhere else - after all, nobody knows exactly where something went wrong until afterwards anyway! You will also notice that many times when looking through published works written about other peoples’ findings, especially those who were very successful during their lifetime (like Einstein). Sometimes these articles contain words like “unconfirmed” or “inconclusive”. However, since almost none of us ever get around reading enough original sources ourselves before writing our own reports/papers based off them alone...we tend towards believing whatever authors tell us without questioning its validity firsthand. So yes--there IS reason behind why academics aren't allowed cheat codes while doing research projects outside school settings! It helps protect against fraudulent claims made publicly available online due solely thanks largely part-time workers whose job descriptions include 'writing'.
There are three ways in which bad data can appear: 1) Forgery – Someone makes up fake numbers or records themselves instead of getting real ones from another source such as surveys taken over time periods spanning years rather than months only; 2) Misrepresentation – A person changes how he presents his results so that they seem better than they actually are; 3) Fabrication – An individual creates fictional characters who give him answers when asked questions related directly back into himself without having done anything except think about possible solutions first handedly prior answering same thing later down line again differently now knowing exactly what happened earlier today afternoon yesterday evening last week month year decade century era period epoch millennia ages eras eons billeniae bifrons centuries millenniums multimillionth"
36,"### Human: Why do humans have to cut their nails and hair, and animals don't?
Also, what did early humans use to cut nails and hair?
 ### Assistant: Humans need to cut their nails and hair because they grow too fast. Animals don’t need to cut them because the growth rate is slower than for human beings. Early humans used sharp stones or shells (for example sea snail) as tools to trim their nails and hair. They also sharpened flint with a piece of bone until it was razor-sharp. It could then be used like a knife to cut things. This type of tool has been found in Europe from 100,000 years ago onwards. The oldest evidence comes from Boxgrove, Sussex in England where there are stone flakes dating back to 526,000 years ago. A more advanced version of this type of tool appeared around 43,000 years ago when the people who lived at Le Moustier in France made small blades out of flint which were hafted onto handles so that they could be used as scrapers, knives or saws. These objects were known as Mousterian tools. Other types include the Aurignacian culture which existed between about 43,000 BC and 38,000 BC. In these times men would probably hunt large mammals such as deer while women gathered plants and fruits and cooked food over fires built using sticks. Some research suggests that children began making simple hand axes around this time but we cannot say whether any other species used similar tools before us. There is no proof yet either way though many scientists think our ancestors might well have done something similar earlier on in prehistory. Many archaeologists believe that hominids living during the Lower Paleolithic period had already developed some form of technology by 2 million years ago. However, most agree today that Homo erectus first learned how to make fire sometime after 1.7 million BP. By 1.2–1.5 mya he may even have begun building shelters from branches covered with leaves or grasses tied together with vines or tree saplings. At least one site near Lake Turkana contains burn marks suggesting controlled burning took place there long before modern man arrived on Earth. But none of these activities can really tell us anything definite about whether Neanderthal Man possessed true intelligence since his brain size appears smaller than those belonging to later humans. We know little else about him except"
37,"### Human: Why did so many non-disabled men in the past carry canes?
Not sure if this is the right place to ask this but I've been wondering this. In old pictures, stories, movies, etc., I always see men carrying canes even if they don't need them to walk. Why do they do this and why did this practice fall out of favor?
 ### Assistant: Before modern medicine, a lot of people had health problems that would make walking hard or impossible without help. For example, most older people have bad knees and hips from age alone; before then, it was common for these joints to be injured by work, warfare, disease, poor diet, lack of exercise, or just plain bad luck. Most of those injuries healed up well enough with time (though some didn't), but they left scars on the bones which made moving difficult. Those who could afford one usually carried a stick to lean on while walking, as did their children when they were small. The same applied to other conditions such as arthritis and spinal cord damage caused by injury or illness. People also used sticks as weapons, especially against wild animals. Carrying a weapon meant you couldn’t use your hands freely, so you needed something else to hold onto.  As medical care improved over the centuries, more and more people became able to get around without using crutches or sticks all the time. This led to fewer people having access to these things—and thus less demand for them overall! Today there are still plenty of places where people carry canes because they want an extra piece of furniture at home rather than anything related specifically toward helping someone move around better physically speaking...but outside North America most countries nowadays require disabled persons to register themselves officially through government agencies like Social Security Administration before receiving any benefits whatsoever related towards disability payments etcetera…which means not everyone gets approved automatically anymore either way since each case needs its own individual review process first anyway."" That said though, historians think it wasn't until after World War II ended that wearing fancy clothes really started becoming popular again among both rich & middle class Americans alike due largely thanks largely thanks mainly because women wanted clothing styles similar ones worn during wartime years prior whereas earlier generations preferred simpler designs instead.. And finally another reason behind rise fashionable attire being worn regularly throughout history was simply fact many soldiers returning home often found themselves unable find jobs elsewhere besides working retail stores selling items ranging everything household appliances kitchenware automobiles tools machinery parts etcetera.... So basically what happened next was simple matter supply meeting demand resulting increased sales revenues leading eventually full blown consumerism boom happening shortly afterwards causing entire economy become dependent upon consumption habits rather saving money long term goals thereby creating problematic"

Hi! I'm a 23 year old student. In recent years I've lived quite unhealthy. I've drank alcohol almost every day, ate fastfood every few days, didn't do a lot of exercise and gained weight (176 lbs to 220 lbs) Now I'm motivated to eat healthy, lose fat by doing cardio and build muscle by working out, drinking lots of water etc. But.. isn't the damage on my body & organs already done (by living like that for years)? Will this change of lifestyle ''restore'' the lack of vitamins and e.g. abuse of alcohol on my liver or will it just prevent things from getting worse? I apologize for my horrible explanation.
 ### Assistant: Hi! I'm a 23 year old student. In recent years I've lived quite unhealthy. I've drunk alcohol almost every day, ate fast food every few days, did not do much exercise and have put on weight (I weighed 176 pounds but now I am 220 pounds). Now I am very motivated to start eating healthily, losing fat through aerobic exercise and building up some muscles in the gym, drink plenty of water, stop smoking etc. However... is all the damage to my body and organs (like my liver which has been damaged by excessive use of alcohol) already done because of me having lived like that over many years ? Or does changing your life style restore what you lost due to bad habits before ? Sorry if i made no sense at all with this question .
Sorry if I don't make any sense here , but I really need help as soon as possible . Thank you !
Yes, there are ways to recover from these problems. Your liver may take longer than other parts of your body, but eventually they should heal themselves. You should also talk to someone about how you feel so that you won't hurt yourself anymore. Good luck!"
39,"### Human: why is there a blood shortage? hospitals charge like $800 per unit. why don't they pay $250 for a donation. everyone would donate. eli5

 ### Assistant: The American Red Cross says that the United States needs more than 13,000 units of red cells every day to help patients at about 2,600 hospitals and transfusion centers nationwide. There are many reasons for this problem. One reason is because hospitals can charge up to $800 per unit of blood when people need it during surgery or treatment. This means that if someone needed two units of blood, their family could be charged over $1,600 by the hospital. That’s too expensive! So not as many people choose to give blood even though it costs only $250 per donation (and most places will let you eat free food afterwards). If we all gave just one pint each year then we wouldn’t have any problems with our national supply chain anymore—we’d never run out again no matter how much demand there was in America alone since so many other countries also depend on us exporting them some type of product from time-to-time which helps keep prices down overall across international markets everywhere around world including Europe where many European nations rely heavily upon imports coming into ports located near major cities throughout continent such France Germany Italy Spain Portugal Netherlands Belgium Luxembourg Ireland Scotland Wales England Denmark Norway Sweden Finland Iceland Estonia Latvia Lithuania Poland Hungary Czech Republic Slovakia Slovenia Croatia Bosnia Herzegovina Serbia Montenegro Macedonia Albania Bulgaria Romania Greece Cyprus Turkey Israel Iran Afghanistan Pakistan India Sri Lanka Thailand Malaysia Indonesia Philippines Vietnam Cambodia Laos Myanmar Singapore Brunei East Timor Papua New Guinea Australia New Zealand Fiji Samoa Tonga Kiribati Tuvalu Nauru Solomon Islands Vanuatu Micronesia Palau Marshall Islands Federated States Of Micronesia Guam Northern Mariana Islands Puerto Rico U.S Virgin Islands St Kitts Nevis Anguilla Antigua Barbuda Aruba Bermuda Cayman Islands Turks Caicos Bahamas Cuba Jamaica Haiti Dominican Republic Trinidad Tobago Grenada Barbados Saint Lucia Martinique Guadeloupe Saint Vincent And The Grenadines Sint Maarten Curacao Venezuela Colombia Ecuador Peru Bolivia Chile Paraguay Uruguay Argentina Brazil Guyana Suriname French Guiana Belize Mexico Costa Rica Nicaragua El Salvador Panama Guatemala Honduras Belarus Ukraine Moldova"

 ### Assistant: An historian is someone who studies history. A person who does this professionally is called a professional historian or an academic historian. Most historians are trained in researching historical sources (primary sources) such as archives, books, documents, letters, etc., so that they can write down facts. This means it's important for them to know how to interpret these sources correctly. They usually also learn some general things about different times periods and places. History has changed over time from being only written by academics to nowadays anyone writing something which could be considered ""history"" even if it isn't true. The term “historian” may refer to people who were not academically educated but still wrote history e.g.: Julius Caesar was never taught at university but he wrote one of the best-known works on ancient Rome; Winston Churchill had no formal training in political sciences yet became Prime Minister during World War II because his writings showed great insight into politics and economics. In order to become successful writers themselves future generations will need both technical skills (writing well) plus good understanding of their subject matter(e.g.: economic theory). Many universities offer degrees specifically designed around teaching students how to write better texts through coursework assignments whereby each student writes several essay papers throughout their four year degree program before graduating with either Bachelor’s Degree or Master's Degree depending upon whether they choose fulltime/part-time status respectively after completing all required courses successfully within specified deadlines set forth by school administration staff members responsible for organizing classes according schedules determined annually based off enrollment numbers received during registration period preceding start date of new semester beginning every September 1st until end day June 30th following summer break when final exams take place across campus locations nationwide throughout United States Of America including Canada too!
A historian should work closely with others outside their own area of expertise. For example, there might be a historian working on medieval Europe who wants to find out what happened between two cities hundreds of miles apart during those centuries. He or she needs help from geographers, linguists, anthropologists, climatologists...and perhaps geneticists too! All these fields overlap sometimes – especially if we look back further than just our lifetime - so collaborative projects like this make sense because everyone gets something valuable out of it while contributing something equally valuable towards achieving common goals together. It doesn"
41,"### Human: how did the usa get the ""i have the right to be offended and you shouldn't offend me"" culture when they have protected free speech?

 ### Assistant: The United States of America has a long history of protecting free speech. Even though many people think that it is wrong, the Supreme Court has said that hate speech is still allowed in public places. However, this does not mean that all hate speech is legal. It just means that there are no laws against saying something racist or sexist. This was decided by the 1968 case Brandenburg v Ohio. In other words, if someone says something racist on television, he cannot go to jail for it unless what he says can cause violence or riots. Because of this decision, most Americans believe that it is illegal to say anything negative about any group (such as blacks). They also tend to think that if anyone says something racist then everyone should stop talking with them until they apologize. When asked why they do this some will answer because “I’m entitled to my opinion.” But actually this is false; according to law every citizen has equal rights under U.S. Constitution regardless of race/ethnicity etc., so there isn’t really such thing like entitlement since nobody owns another person but himself alone without having paid money first beforehand! What makes things even worse nowadays however remains unclear whether those who claim otherwise truly understand their country's founding documents properly enough themselves...
The USA got the ""i have the right to be offended and you shouldn't offend me"" culture from its original constitution which states that freedom comes at cost - meaning one must accept responsibility along side enjoyment too while exercising freedoms granted within limits set forth by government itself through legislation passed down over time via amendments made during times where changes were necessary due mainly political reasons rather than moral ones per se .

42,"### Human: i see kids that are younger and younger with glasses every day. how do they measure how they can see and how bad their eyes are when it's literally a baby that can't even walk or talk, let alone read letters aloud from an eye exam?

 ### Assistant: An eye chart is used to test visual acuity (how well someone sees). It was created by the Dutch ophthalmologist Herman Snellen in 1862. Eye charts have been updated since then. The most common one is called the Snellen eye chart because of its creator. Today, it uses English alphabetical characters instead of German ones. It also has different sized lettering so people who cannot read can still be tested for vision problems like nearsightedness or farsightedness using this method as long as there are no other disabilities involved such as cataracts which would make reading impossible anyway without corrective lenses being worn all at once! Some schools use larger versions made out of cardboard boxes painted black on both sides while others prefer smaller ones printed onto paper sheets so students don’t need extra time taking tests during class hours due to lack thereof . This article will go into detail about what makes up these two types along with some examples below : - Standard Sizes For A School Setting : These usually come pre-made but if not then you could always print them off yourself just remember though that bigger isn't necessarily better unless your child needs glasses already before school starts back up again after summer break ends around September each year depending upon where exactly live within North America ; however sometimes teachers might want something special ordered specifically tailored towards whatever grade level(Kindergarten/First Grade)they teach so ask ahead first before making any assumptions here please ! Also note down whether there were any changes made overtime because maybe certain words weren't clear enough initially compared against today's standards set forth by OSHA regulations etcetera...
There are many different kinds of eye charts available nowadays including those designed especially for children under five years old who may struggle more than adults do when trying figure out what kind letter corresponds with number associated with said word choice(either uppercase lower case ). So yes indeed ,it does matter quite significantly whether we choose right away rather later down road because accuracy matters too – especially given fact that our brains tend process information faster earlier stages development than later ones do . Therefore early intervention becomes essential component overall success story regardless age group involved either way roundabout thing goes . As long everyone plays fair game according rules laid out prior beginning process itself things should work smoothly without issues popping up unexpectedly somewhere else further along line . Thanks good luck hope helps somehow !!

43,"### Human: if we put a large mirror 100 lightyears from earth, would we be able see the past?

 ### Assistant: If we put a large mirror (a few kilometers across) 100 light years away from Earth in space and looked at it with an optical telescope on Earth, we would see things that happened when the light was emitted. That means we could see things as they were 100 years ago! In other words, we can look back into time by looking outwards. This is called ""gravitational lensing"". It happens because of gravity; the sun bends the path of the light coming from faraway objects. The more massive something is, the bigger its gravitational field will be and the stronger the effect will be. So a black hole has a much stronger gravitational field than the Sun does. Black holes are very strong sources of gravitational waves and so astronomers use them to find gravitational waves. Because a black hole's event horizon prevents anything escaping, including light, there should not be any information about what is inside one. However, according to quantum mechanics, even particles which cannot escape must obey certain laws. These laws say that some small amount of energy always leaks from the black hole, like radiation or heat. This leakage causes tiny vibrations or ripples in spacetime known as gravitational waves. Gravity Waves have been detected for the first time ever by scientists using LIGO detectors. Scientist Rainer Weiss, Kip Thorne and Barry Barish won the Nobel Prize in Physics this year for their work on these detections. According to Einstein’s theory of relativity, all mass warps the fabric of space-time around itself. When two big masses move closer together, such as two stars merging, the distortion becomes greater, creating gravitational waves. The idea behind how you make the detection was invented by Albert Einstein himself. He proposed that these “ripples” in space travel through the universe at the speed of light. As soon as he had thought up his idea, he realised that no one would believe him unless someone saw it happening. The way the gravitational wave detectors work is quite complicated but basically, each part of the equipment measures whether there is more force being applied due to the passing of a gravitational wave. Then, the data collected is analysed and compared against previous results. A signal can only be considered true once many people agree that it looks right. Nowadays, scientists have developed special techniques for doing this"

So, is there anything capable of withstanding direct long-term contact with lava? Like some type of metal or something?
 ### Assistant: Lava is a fluid rock. It can be found in volcanoes and around the Earth's crust (mantle).  The only thing that will survive being inside it for very long are things like diamonds, which have a high melting point. Diamond has an even higher melting temperature than gold or silver. If you put your hand into molten lava, it would melt within seconds. Even if wearing gloves made out of the strongest metals on earth, they could not protect from this kind of heat. However, no human can hold their breath underwater forever; eventually they need air to breathe again! This means that people who dive deep enough down below sea level may die because they cannot get any more oxygen while diving deeper still without surfacing first so as not to suffocate themselves when reaching such depths where all life ceases existing altogether due lack thereof (or else why bother going anywhere near those places anyway?) So yes--there IS indeed something called ""lava""...but unfortunately nothing exists which can stand up against its intense power over time unless maybe someone were able somehow manage living permanently beneath its surface area before finally succumbing themselves completely by simply staying too close too long until everything turns black & charred beyond recognition afterwards.""
Lava is hotter than most other substances on earth. It burns at about .

45,"### Human: What made the soldiers of the Army of Northern Virginia ""better""?
I've been seeing assertions for years that the Army of Northern Virginia had some innate qualities that made it ""better"" than the Army of the Potomac, at least early on in the war. This goes beyond generalship, but seems to imply, basically, that the rank-and-file Southerners were better soldiers somehow than their Northern counterparts. But this is usually left unexplained. Is there any truth to these claims?
 ### Assistant: The assertion that Confederates were superior fighters has a long history and many sources. It was popularized by Jeb Stuart who claimed that his men could fight all day against three times as many Yankees. He also wrote that they were well fed with plenty of rest while the Union army lived off hardtack and cold coffee or water. However, historians have debunked those stories. They point out that both armies suffered from poor nutrition due to lack of supplies. Both sides fought on an empty stomach most days during 1862. As far as fatigue went, the South did not allow its men much time to sleep. So if anything, the North may have gotten more rest. Many Civil War veterans spoke about how tired they felt after fighting one battle let alone two or three like they often experienced. At Gettysburg, General Lee said he would attack again tomorrow even though the Confederates had lost so badly. That shows just how exhausted they really were. Another factor was the difference between the northern and southern troops’ uniforms. The north wore blue which blended into the landscape. If you look closely at pictures taken at Antietam (Sharpsburg), the south wears grey or khaki which stands out clearly making them easier targets. In addition, when looking back on battles such as Fredericksburg where Longstreet charged up Marye’s heights only half dressed because ammunition was low, historians say that wasn’t because he didn’t care about winning; rather it was likely due to supply problems caused by railroads being cut off from Richmond by Union cavalry raids deep inside enemy territory. These are examples showing why neither side can be called “superior” compared to another. There isn’t enough evidence either way since both sides faced similar challenges throughout four bloody years of combat operations. One thing remains true however: no matter what happened before or after each battle took place, whether victory or defeat occurred – both sides always showed amazing courage under fire until death came knocking upon their doorstep eventually ending everyone involved within reach range distance proximity nearness vicinity closeness immediacy closeness closeness nearby location close together near adjacent neighboring contiguous adjoining borderline fringe periphery next door around here downstairs across town over yonder roundabout distant aloof afield away apart isolated remotely removed outside remote outlying outer"

The Imperial (or English) system of weights and measures;
A system based on 16 feet to the mile; and
A unit of currency with one dollar equal to about half an ounce of gold. This meant that people could easily work out how much money things cost if they knew what their weight was. This standard lasted until 1975, when it was replaced by SI. Since then, most countries around the world have switched over to using this new system. However, the US has kept its old system because it does not want any more change than necessary at once. It also thinks that having two different standards will be confusing for consumers who might buy products from both countries without knowing which ones they're buying! In addition, some Americans still prefer the imperial system even though there aren’t many left anymore since most places now sell goods exclusively using metric measurements instead."" The United States is the only country, apart from Liberia and Burma, not to have adopted the International System of Units as its official system of measurement. Although it uses U.S.-specific forms such as ""pound"", ""quart,"" etc., these terms refer directly back into our own culture rather than being part of some foreign language like French where we get confused when trying translate words correctly. Some American businesses may choose whether they want their customers ordering items according to pounds versus kilograms depending upon preference but generally speaking most stores stick strictly within one category unless specifically requested otherwise during checkout time at storefront locations throughout America today..

47,"### Human: What is it about our place in the galaxy which makes it so conducive for the existence of life? What about our place in the greater clusters and beyond?

 ### Assistant: The Milky Way, a spiral shaped collection of stars and planets. It has an estimated 200 to 400 billion stars (and possibly more). Our Solar System orbits around one star at its centre. This star, called the Sun, is one of many similar stars found throughout the Galaxy. The Sun is part of the Orion Spur, near the inner edge of the Sagittarius Arm. The Sun lies between two major arms, Perseus arm and Scutum-Centaurus arm, also known as Near 3 kpc Arm and Far 3 kpc Arm respectively. There are other smaller structures inside these two larger ones such as Local Bubble, Gould Belt and Norma-Cygnus Arm. Our solar system's position within this area means that there are lots of large molecular clouds nearby. These provide raw materials for new star formation. In addition, our sun was born when the local interstellar medium density was high enough for star formation. Stars form from dense regions of gas and dust where gravity pulls material together into clumps. When they get massive enough, hydrogen fuses under pressure until helium is formed, releasing energy. If there isn’t much matter present, then not much heat will be released; if too much mass is concentrated in one place, nuclear fusion becomes unstable and explodes instead of burning steadily. Most stars do neither - they stay small because they don't have enough stuff around them to collapse further down into heavier elements like carbon or oxygen atoms. However some stars manage to grow big enough before running out of fuel for their cores. Once ignited, these giants continue expanding through several stages over millions of years until eventually becoming red supergiant stars with diameters hundreds times bigger than those seen today! After dying off naturally due either supernovae explosions or white dwarf remnant cooling processes depending upon how long ago we look back along cosmic time lines towards past events occurring during early universe history centuries after creation took place according Genesis account written Old Testament Bible book Genesis chapter 1 verses 1 thru 5 describing God creating heaven earth waters plants animals birds fish insects etc..

48,"### Human: decades ago, how were people able to get married in their 20's, have kids, afford a house, live/strive rather comfortably, and still have enough saved up to retire?
Not specific to U.S. neither. Even my home country now in Asia - bachelor's degree gets you lower wage jobs, enough for food/rent, but barely afford a car, and almost no hopes for a house. What's changed in the past decades? & nbsp; & nbsp; EDIT: This is depressing.
 ### Assistant: In the United States, before 1973 it was possible for someone who started working at age 18 (and had a job that paid well) to be married with children by age 25 or so, buy a nice home with 3 bedrooms, 2 baths, and a garage in a good school district by age 30, put away money into an IRA or other tax-sheltered investment account, and still have plenty of money left over to enjoy life after work. Nowadays, not only are most young adults struggling just to pay off college loans, they can't even think about buying a home until their mid-thirties, if ever. Why did this happen? It has been said that many factors contributed to the change. Here are some examples.
Increasing population density means more competition for housing. The average size of new homes built since 1970 has shrunk from around 1600 square feet to less than 1400 square feet. Also, there are fewer single family houses being built these days as compared to apartments and condos. So what used to cost $70k will now run closer to $200k. And then add on property taxes, insurance costs, etc. There's also the fact that two-income families need larger houses because both parents usually work full time outside the home today. Then throw in higher interest rates due to inflation. That makes mortgages much harder to qualify for unless your credit score is excellent or better. All these things combined make it difficult for young couples trying to start out together financially speaking without help from Mommy Dearest! But don't worry too much though--you won't see any changes happening soon either way...the market keeps going down each year despite all efforts made towards stabilizing prices again through government intervention programs like Fannie Mae which provide low income borrowers access into owning properties themselves instead relying solely upon renting units owned privately elsewhere else where within city limits where rents remain high regardless of whether tenants receive assistance via Section 8 voucher program offered locally here inside Washington DC metropolitan area boundaries itself specifically designated under federal law governing same kind service provided nationwide across entire continental United States territory excluding Alaska Hawaii territories respectively mentioned above already included under separate legislative acts passed separately prior"
49,"### Human: Is there any connection between the term ""White Russian"" for anti communists and the translation of Belarus ""White Russia?""

 ### Assistant: White Russians is a name that was used by some people to describe themselves. They were opponents against Communism in the former Soviet Union, but did not support Nazi Germany during World War II. The term came from the translation of Belarus (the country) as 'White Russia'. There are also other groups who use this name. One group calls itself the White Russian Army or WRA, which opposes the government of Ukraine. Another one called the White Russian Movement says they want freedom for all peoples living in Russia. Both these organizations have been declared terrorist organizations by the United States Department of State because their activities include violence towards civilians and property damage caused by explosives such as bombs planted at airports near Moscow's Red Square area where tourists visit frequently every year around Christmas time when temperatures drop below zero degrees Celsius (-18 Fahrenheit). This makes travel difficult unless you know how cold it will be outside before leaving home! So if your trip plans include going somewhere warmer than usual then consider taking extra clothes along with warm blankets just in case something happens while en route back home again later on down south after spending days exploring new places abroad far away from familiar surroundings like family members waiting anxiously awaiting news about whether everything went well enough so nobody got hurt badly enough requiring hospitalization afterwards due primarily due lack proper preparation prior departure date set forth earlier agreed upon timeline schedule accordingly without delay unnecessarily prolonging unneeded delays resulting unnecessary stress levels exceedingly high above average norm standards expected normalcy typicality commonality accepted general acceptance widespread approval universal agreement worldwide consensus broadly shared understanding mutually beneficial outcome favorable resolution satisfactory conclusion happy ending successful completion triumphant victory glorious celebrations joyous festivities merrymaking revelries jubilation exuberance gaiety mirthfulness amusement frivolity festivity conviviality socializing fun times hilarity humor laughter smiles giggling chuckles guffaws roars cackles shrieks screams yells bellows barks whimpers squeals grunts groans growls snorts wheezes hisses purrs mews rumbles murmurs whispers moans gasps grimaces crinkles wrinkles puckering curdling scrunching squinching pinching clenches knots bunches"
50,"### Human: how does the internet connect to other continents?
Is/was there giant fiber optic tubes across the oceans? (I'm pretty sure telephone lines had wire under the ocean).
 ### Assistant: Undersea Internet Cable is a type of submarine communications cable. It allows for data transfer between computers and networks in different countries, or even continents. The cables are laid on the floor of an ocean. They can be buried at depths up to 10 km (6 miles) below sea level. This means they do not get damaged by storms or fishing boats. Some cables use optical fibers that carry many signals simultaneously along with one main signal. Other cables may only have one or two fibres. A single fibre can transmit about 25 terabits per second. That's enough to stream 75 million high-definition movies at once. As of December 31, 2019, there were over 480 active submarine cables around the world carrying more than 100% of global Internet bandwidth. In some areas like the Mediterranean Sea, Red Sea, Caribbean Sea and parts of Asia, Africa and South America, these cables carry almost all international traffic. There was also plans to build a giant fiber optic tube across the Pacific Ocean called TPE-IX. However this plan has been scrapped. Instead it will now be replaced by another project named Faster. These projects would link Japan, China and United States together via Taiwan, Hong Kong and Guam respectively. The idea behind them is simple - increase capacity while reducing costs associated with building new infrastructure from scratch every time something needs updating/replacing etc.. So far we know nothing else except what I just told you above but stay tuned because things could change quickly!

51,"### Human: how does a touchscreen work?
And how does it know if you're using a finger or not?
 ### Assistant: A touch screen is an input device that lets the user to interact with their computer by simply touching on a flat surface. The technology used in this type of devices has been developed and improved over time, but its basic principle remains unchanged. Whenever something touches the display, the system sends signals to the computer which then recognizes what was touched (a finger or stylus) as well as where exactly did it happen so that appropriate actions can be taken accordingly. This way users don’t have any problems while browsing through webpages because they will always see whatever information needed at once without having to scroll down every page just like before when there were no such things available yet! There are many different kinds depending upon whether one wants them mounted onto desktops/laptops etc., placed within tablets & smartphones...or even embedded into walls & doors too!! Some models allow multiple fingers being detected simultaneously whereas others only recognize single digit ones – however both types offer similar features except maybe some minor differences here&there; usually these days most people prefer using capacitive screens instead since those provide better accuracy than resistive ones do due to lack of pressure sensors inside each pixel area itself making sure everything works perfectly fine all throughout regardless of what kind we choose from among various options out there today… And finally let me tell u why I think this topic matters alot bcoz nowadays almost everyone uses mobile phones for communication purposes especially youngsters who spend lots of money buying latest gadgets just 4 fun sake alone… So yeah!!! Let us try understanding more about it below …
The human body emits electrical currents when someone touches something else, called “capacitance.” For example, your hand might feel cold against metal after holding a hot drink for long periods of time because electrons flow from the object back towards themselves rather quickly creating heat energy along the pathway between two points separated by distance - this process also creates static electricity charges which build up until discharged either naturally or artificially via friction against another material such as wool clothing worn during winter months causing shocks when rubbed together repeatedly enough times under certain conditions including dryness versus wetness levels present around our skin cells making contact with surfaces outside ourselves respectively speaking generally speaking though not necessarily true universally applicable everywhere across globe worldwide continental landmasses oceans seas lakes rivers streams ponds swamps marshlands estuaries lagoons coastlines shores"
52,"### Human: how were they able to increase the speed of usb 2.0 40 times compared to usb 1.1. it's using exactly the same connector with the same 4 wires and the same shielding.
USB 1.1 has 12 Mbit/s while USB 2.0 has a speed of 480 Mbit/s, but how? Why didn't they make is 480Mbit/s the first time?
 ### Assistant: The USB specification was created by Intel in early 1996 for internal use only. In late 1997, Compaq, DEC, IBM, Microsoft, NEC, and Northern Telecom formed an industry group called ""The Universal Serial Bus Implementers Forum"" (USB-IF). This forum took over development of the specification from Intel. They then released version 1.1 on January 5th, 1998. It had two speeds; Low Speed (LS) at 1.5 Mbit/s and Full Speed (FS) at 12 Mbit/s. These are still used today along side High Speed (HS), SuperSpeed (SS) and SuperSpeed+ (SS+) versions that have been introduced since. USB 3.x uses the same physical connectors as previous versions but adds new signals which can be detected through software. This allows older devices to continue working without any changes required. However, this also means that newer versions cannot communicate directly with older ones unless both sides support backwards compatibility mode. If one device does not understand what another wants, communication will fail until either party updates their firmware or hardware drivers respectively. Even though these problems exist, most people don't notice them because there aren't many products out yet supporting USB 3.x technology. As more companies start making things compatible with USB 3.x technologies, we should see fewer issues like those mentioned above happening going forward into future generations of computers! When designing USB 2.0, engineers decided against increasing bandwidth beyond 480Mbps due to concerns about power consumption when transferring large amounts of data quickly between different components within systems such as motherboards & graphics cards etc.. By keeping bandwidth low enough so no additional power needs to be supplied during operation - this helps reduce overall system heat generated while running applications requiring high levels performance under heavy loads e.g., gaming etc... Although initially planned for release later down line after initial launch date(s) - eventually got pushed back further than expected resulting in delays before finally getting released sometime around mid year 2001 just prior Windows XP SP2 update rollout period began rolling out globally across various regions worldwide including Europe North America Asia Pacific Latin America Middle East Africa South America Oceania Antarctica Arctic Circle Polar Regions etcetera… After much debate amongst members involved within project teams responsible developing specifications"
53,"### Human: allergy medicine. since it is an anti-histemine, does it not suppress the immune system? is it easier to catch things like influenza or the cold while on allergy medicine?

 ### Assistant: Anti-histamines are medications that treat allergies by blocking histamine receptors in our body. They do this by attaching themselves onto a specific part of these receptor cells and preventing them from getting activated when they come into contact with allergens such as pollen or pet dander (dust mites). The most common type of antihistamine drug available today is called ""first generation"" because its first use was discovered over 50 years ago but there has been no new discovery made since then! It's also known for causing sedation so people should avoid driving after taking one if possible because side effects can include feeling tired/sleepy even though you haven’t done anything strenuous beforehand which could lead someone else being hurt due lack awareness about their surroundings while operating machinery etc.. Other types include second generation ones where some have less risk factors associated with them compared previous versions although both still cause similar problems depending upon dosage taken; third generations tend not affect sleep patterns quite as much either making them safer options overall especially during nighttime hours.""

54,"### Human: why are airlines able to sell more seats than are available on a flight?

 ### Assistant: The term ""overbooking"" is used in the airline industry. It means that an airline sells more tickets for a flight, even though there may not be enough space (seats) available. This happens because some people do not show up at all or arrive late and miss their flights. Airlines make money by overbooking flights; they can charge extra fees if passengers have to wait for another flight. However, sometimes this causes problems when too many people turn up for one particular flight - then nobody gets onto it! In such cases you might get stuck somewhere without any way home until another plane arrives later with empty seats available inside its cabin area...or worse still: stranded abroad while waiting around hoping someone else's plans change so yours will go through instead."" Overbookings occur quite often nowadays thanks mainly due advances made recently within technology sector which allows companies operating within transportation businesses worldwide access real-time information about demand levels across entire networks simultaneously enabling them react quickly whenever required ensuring customer satisfaction remains high always no matter what happens during course journey completion process itself resulting eventually into positive feedback loop leading towards increased sales volume overall revenue generation potentiality going forward year after next decade ahead continuously improving quality service delivery standards higher each passing day accordingly achieving long-term sustainable growth strategies successfully implemented effectively meeting target objectives set forth initially designed basis originally intended purpose created fulfillment mission statement ultimately accomplish desired outcomes expected results realized end goal achieved victory celebrations held festivities enjoyed joyous occasions marked memorable milestones reached triumphant successes celebrated victories declared congratulations expressed gratitude acknowledged achievements recognized contributions made significant impact felt throughout community appreciated efforts put forth dedication shown commitment demonstrated loyalty displayed courage exhibited bravery displayed determination revealed strength showed perseverance proved resilience fought hard battles won wars conquered challenges faced overcome obstacles surmounted difficulties encountered prevailed against odds defeated adversaries crushed opposition vanquished foe subdued enemy forced submission bowed down before superior force yielded power relinquish authority ceded control given away ownership transferred rights surrendered property abandoned holdings released claims laid claim discarded title dropped charges renounced responsibility abdicated position vacated office stepped aside delegated duty passed torch handed baton accepted mantle took helm assumed command led expedition guided expedition directed operation commanded unit supervised enterprise oversaw project"
55,"### Human: Serious: What happened to the train Lenin used to travel back to Russia in 1917?
Russian fiancée and I have searched without luck. History major myself and suddenly wondered what happened to the train? Is it in a museum somewhere? Destroyed, scrapped? One of the small things that are now annoying me, will bug me, until I know.
 ### Assistant: The Sevastopol was one of three trains owned by Vladimir Lenin for his use after he left Russia at the start of World War I. It traveled through Siberia with him on board when he returned from exile in January 1917. He gave up ownership soon afterwards. After being damaged during the Russian Civil War, the locomotive was restored as an exhibit at the Railway Museum in St Petersburg. In 2003, the engine was removed so restoration work could be done, but has not been seen since then. The fate of the other two cars is unknown. This article includes a list of references related to this topic. It may also include links to online documents or images. Please help us by adding more sources if you can. Use for citations must follow Wikipedia's citation rules. (December 2014) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)
The first car was built in 1865 and had originally been named ""Sveti Peterburg"". When it became part of Lenin's personal railroad train, its name changed to ""Leninsky"" (""Lenin's""). During the October Revolution, the car was renamed ""Oktjabrskij Revolucion"", which means ""October Revolution"". This car still exists, although no longer under any name. It is located outside Moscow at a railway station called Krasnoznamenskaya-Kolomna. As of December 2014, there were plans to restore it as an exhibition hall. These plans did not materialize, however, because of lack of funds. The second car was named ""Gorky"" in honor of Maxim Gorky. It later disappeared; the date of disappearance is unclear. The third car, known as the dining room, remains unidentified. Some reports say it burned down in 1920, while others report that it was destroyed by German bombing raids in Leningrad in August 1941. There are conflicting accounts about whether the car even existed before Lenin bought it. If it did exist, it probably came from Germany. Its destination would have been either Saint Petersburg or Finland. At least one source claims that it survived into Soviet times, having become part of the collection at the Central Museum of Railways. That museum closed in 2007, though. Nothing further is reported"
56,"### Human: how come eyebrow, eyelash, arm hairs, ect only grow to a certain point, but when you shave them they grow back? how does it know it's been shaved? why don't they continuously grow like head hair?

 ### Assistant: A Hair is the thick filamentous structure that grows from follicles in the skin of mammals. The human body has around 5 million hairs on average. In humans and other animals with fur, the hair usually consists of a root which is buried under the surface of the skin (the ""follicle""), a stem or shaft, and the above-ground part, called the ""hair"". The hair grows from an outgrowth at the base of the follicle known as the papillae. Humans have different types of hair distributed across their bodies. Eyebrows, for example are short and fine, while hair on the arms is longer and thicker. Head hair ranges between these two extremes; eyelid hair is very thin. Scalp hair can be several feet long if uncut. There are also vibrissae (whiskers) and some nonhuman primates have dense body hair called pelage. Chimpanzees shed their pelage once every year. Body hair may help prevent overheating by reflecting heat away from the body. It might also act as protection against ultraviolet light and insect bites. Some studies show that male pattern baldness may be caused by the presence of dihydrotestosterone (DHT). DHT affects both scalp hair and pubic hair. Facial hair growth during adolescence occurs due to changes in hormonal balance. Men typically develop more facial hair than women. This is because men produce much higher amounts of testosterone than women do. During puberty, estrogen levels rise sharply in girls while boys experience a rapid increase in testosterone levels. Estrogens promote female characteristics such as breast development and fat storage whereas testosterones cause muscle building and bone strengthening. Testosterones stimulate sebaceous glands to produce oil needed for healthy skin cells. Sebum production increases dramatically after reaching sexual maturity. However, excessive secretion leads to acne breakouts. Acnes appear most commonly near areas where sweat accumulates including armpits, groin region, chest area, face, neck, upper back, shoulders, etc.. Most people lose about half their original number of hairs each decade starting at age twenty five until death. At birth there were approximately three hundred thousand strands per square centimeter. By age sixty four this"
57,"### Human: Two guys in Poland are claiming they found an old Nazi train loaded with gold deep in a Polish mountain, can somebody tell me more about this and are there more WOII myths/stories like these?
I saw quite some articles about it on news websites like this one from the Guardian but i would like to learn more about this story or stories like this one If the train is really packed with gold it would be such a nice scenario for a new Indiana Jones movie
 ### Assistant: In 2015 two guys in Poland (a country of Europe) claimed that they had discovered an old Nazi train loaded with gold. The train was supposedly hidden by the Germans near Walbrzych during World War II. It's not clear if the claims were true. There have been many other similar rumors over time. Some people think that most of them are fake. However, sometimes treasure hunters do find something valuable after years of searching. For example, in September 2014 a group of hobby divers found a shipwreck off South Carolina which contained lots of coins worth millions of dollars. Another famous case happened when Mel Fisher recovered $400 million of Spanish treasure from the sea floor. This took him almost three decades to accomplish. A few weeks ago another German train with hundreds of tons of explosives was also found in Germany. So who knows what else might still be out there somewhere...! If you want to know more about Nazis trains check here. And if you are interested in knowing more about nazi gold go here. You could also search the internet for ""Nazi Gold Train"" or ""Walbrzych"". Also see my answer below as well as those from other users.
There are so many wartime legends that I thought it may be useful to put together a list. Here goes:
A U-boat full of gold bars sank in Lake Ontario in Canada. See http://www.lakeontariogold.com/.
Another U-boat carrying billions of US dollars went missing in the Caribbean Sea. Read https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_Mormacrey .
The Amber Room at Tsarskoye Selo was looted by the Nazis and taken back to Berlin. They hid it somewhere in Königsberg Castle before fleeing the advancing Soviet army. Since then nobody has seen it again. Some say it ended up in Russia; others believe it got lost underground in Berlin where the castle used to stand. To read more click here.
Also see the article on Wikipedia called List of Nazi plunder. Many objects disappeared without trace. Maybe they will turn up sometime soon...!
And finally, you should watch the Indiana Jones movies to get a feel for how exciting discovering ancient treasures can be! :)

58,"### Human: how many sides can a shape have before it becomes a circle and does the concept of geometry exist on the very small scale?

 ### Assistant: A polygon is any closed plane figure that has more than two sides. The number of sides determines what kind of polygon it is, for example triangles are polygons with three sides, quadrilaterals are polygons with four sides, pentagons are polygons with five sides and so forth. There is no upper limit to the number of sides (sides) a polygon may have; in fact there exists an infinite amount of polygonal shapes with any possible number of sides. However, when we talk about circles or spheres, then their definition includes them having an infinity of sides. This means they do not fit into our description above as ""polygon"". We would call them circular figures instead, but if we wanted to use the term ""poly-gon"" here too, then this could be done by saying that every point of a circle makes up one side of the circle. So, the idea of poly-gons applies both ways - whether you count all points inside the shape or only those outside its boundary line. In other words, each vertex forms part of either an exterior edge or interior face depending upon which type was chosen at construction time (or during editing). When talking about smaller objects like atoms, molecules etc., where things get much closer together due to quantum effects such as tunneling through barriers between particles...we cannot say exactly how many corners there really should be since they're just tiny little dots compared to us humans! But still, mathematicians study these tiny details because even though everything looks smooth from far away sometimes when viewed under magnification using powerful microscopes - there might actually exist some irregularities hidden beneath surface appearances . For instance think about mountains made out rock layers stacked up against each other forming steep cliffs overlooking valleys below…this isn’t always true though – sometimes water erodes away parts until only flat land remains left behind after millions years worth changes happening slowly throughout history without anyone realizing anything had happened except maybe scientists who studied geology long enough ago back then before modern technology existed yet today where computers help solve mysteries faster than ever imagined possible centuries earlier while people lived simpler lives without electricity running through homes everywhere across America.” 
The question of how many sides a shape must have before it becomes a circle is unsolved. It is known that for n > 4, there is a unique regular convex polygon with n sides whose circumcircle passes through exactly half of the vertices of the polygon. All"
59,"### Human: Why does a function converge or diverge?
In my Calculus class we are studying improper integrals. We were given the function f(x) =x-3 and f(x) = x-1/3 The cube function diverges and the cube root function converges, but why? What happens near 0 at infinity that causes the different behavior?
 ### Assistant: A function can be defined in many ways; one way is to say what value it has for each input (or argument). If there is more than one possible output for any input then the function ""diverges"" because its definition allows two or more outputs for some inputs. For example, if I give you an infinite amount of money per year forever, how much will you have after n years? One answer could be $n2 + 1$, which means your total balance would increase by squaring itself every year. This function grows faster and faster as time goes on so this kind of growth cannot happen with real money since it's finite. But another solution might be $e^n$ where e represents Euler’s number - about 2.718281828459... That’s also growing very quickly! In fact both these functions grow faster than anything else over time so they “diverge” from reality. However if we take either one out into space far enough away from us until all matter disappears then their values become equal again – making them convergent instead of diverging anymore like before when we were close together inside our galaxy or universe respectively. So even though things look bad now don’t worry too much just yet because eventually everything will come back around full circle once again someday soon enough provided nothing changes along the way between here today versus tomorrow morning tomorrow afternoon next week later month year century decade millennia centuries ages eras epochs geological periods ice ages glacial cycles interglaciations warming trends cooling phases climate shifts seasons winter spring summer fall autumn equinoxes solstices vernal equinox northern hemisphere southern hemisphere tropical subtropical temperate polar arctic antarctic tropic subarctic boreal tundra taiga coniferous deciduous mixed broadleaf evergreen needle leaf shrub grass prairie savanna steppe desert scrubland woodland marsh swamp fen bog peat moss meadow field pasture rangeland lawn park garden agricultural farm ranch range grazing lands herds migration migratory seasonal breeding nesting hibernation migrating birds insects amphibians reptiles fishes marine freshwater estuary ocean sea lake river stream pond wetlands coastline seashore beach sand dunes shore cliff rocks mountains plateaus valleys plains basin lowland"
60,"### Human: In movies, people smash their head on someone else's head unfazed. Can anyone do that? Doesn't it cause fairly equal damage?
Just wondering...
 ### Assistant: People in movies sometimes hit their heads against the other person’s head or something hard and they don’t seem to be hurt at all. They get up like nothing happened. Is this realistic? Could I actually do that without hurting myself as well? If you are talking about hitting your own head with a baseball bat (or another blunt object) then yes; if you were able to avoid getting hurt by doing so, then no one would ever use guns instead of bats. However, there is an exception to this rule: when two objects collide together, both will lose some energy from each other because they transfer momentum back-and-forth between themselves until eventually stopping completely. This means that even though only half the force was transferred into either object after impacting them directly onto something solid such as concrete floors/walls etc., over time those forces will add up enough for everyone involved including yourself who did not participate directly but still received part of whatever fell off during collisions along its path towards ground zero where everything came crashing down upon itself once again! 
In reality though, people usually end up bleeding quite badly due to how much pressure builds up inside our skulls while trying these things out for ourselves since we cannot control what happens next unless trained professionals intervene beforehand otherwise known as ""head trauma"". The brain needs oxygenated blood flow through arteries which feed nutrients straight into neurons located deep within grey matter regions where thoughts originate from - so imagine having less than ideal circumstances where somebody gets knocked unconscious just because they tripped over something unexpectedly right underneath feet! It doesn't take long before life support systems start shutting down because there isn't any food being digested anymore nor does anything else work properly except maybe breathing since lungs continue functioning normally despite lacking sufficient amounts required elsewhere throughout body parts affected most severely.
It is possible for humans to survive a direct blow from heavy items like rocks, bricks and pipes, although this depends on many factors such as size of the item used as weaponry against them plus strength behind swing delivered at speed high enough not only break bones but also penetrate skin tissue causing internal injuries leading ultimately death eventually followed soon afterwards by organ failure resulting from loss of blood supply needed sustain living cells alive within organs responsible keeping us going day after day without fail until finally reaching point where nothing works correctly anymore leaving victim unable"
61,"### Human: a long time ago, a person was able to work 40 hours a week and support a family. today two people need to work 40 hours a week to barely support themselves living together. what changed?

 ### Assistant: The cost of living is the amount of money that a person needs for their basic expenses in life, such as food, shelter, clothing, transportation, etc.. It has increased over many years so that it takes more than one income to live comfortably nowadays. In the United States there are different costs depending on where you live; some areas have higher prices for things like housing or gasoline because they're closer to other cities with high demand (such as New York City). This means that if someone wants to move away from these places then they will probably spend less money overall but still be able to afford everything else just fine without having any trouble paying bills each month! The term ""cost of living"" can also refer specifically towards rent/mortgage payments which tend not only include utilities but also insurance coverage too since landlords usually require tenants pay both before signing leases anyway.""

62,"### Human: why are shows like dr.oz allowed to give out health advice that isn't scientifically supported? how isn't this considered illegal?

 ### Assistant: Dr. Oz is an American television personality and doctor who gives medical advice on his show, The Doctor Oz Show (often called just ""Dr. Oz""). He also appears in other media such as books, magazines, radio programs, podcasts, etc.. In 2014, he was criticized for giving bad information about weight loss products on the air. Many people say that it should be against the law because there is no evidence behind what he says. But many others think that it shouldn't be a problem if someone wants to listen or not. It can even help them lose some pounds! If you want more info about Dr.Oz please visit https://www.doctoroz.com/page/about-dr-mehmet-oz . You will find all of your questions answered here!

63,"### Human: as someone from the uk, i have no idea why obamacare has been getting so much hate. explain.
I really just have not clue.
 ### Assistant: ObamaCare is a nickname for Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), which was passed into law by Congress in 2010. It makes it possible to buy health insurance at low prices if you do not get health coverage through your employer or another source like Medicare or Medicaid. The law also says that every American must either be covered by an insurance plan or pay a fine. This part of the law is called ""the individual mandate."" Insurance companies cannot refuse people who want to join their plans because they are sick. They can only deny them if they live somewhere else than where the company sells its policies. They also cannot charge more money to older customers. People with pre-existing conditions will still be able to find affordable coverage. A lot of these rules were already being used by states before this law was made. Afterwards, all fifty U.S. states had to follow these same rules when giving out new private health care plans. Many other countries use similar systems to make sure everyone gets good medical treatment without having too many problems about cost. These laws help keep down how expensive healthcare costs become over time because there's less risk involved when providing services to patients who might need them later on but don't know yet whether they'll ever develop any serious illnesses requiring long term treatments like chemotherapy or surgery. There aren't enough hospitals around anymore due to budget cuts so most Americans end up going bankrupt trying hard to save themselves after falling sick while working fulltime jobs elsewhere away from home - leaving behind families back home waiting anxiously each day wondering what happened next until finally receiving word via phone call announcing death followed shortly afterwards by funeral arrangements made quickly since nobody wants those kinds of conversations happening again soon! I believe we should fix our broken system instead of repealing parts like this one piece at once though because otherwise nothing changes except maybe worse things happen faster now thanks government shutdowns causing even more chaos everywhere including inside hospitals across America where staff members continue working tirelessly despite lacking adequate supplies needed right now during emergencies such as hurricanes Harvey & Irma recently occurred simultaneously resulting widespread destruction throughout entire regions affected heavily thus leading towards potential disaster scenarios occurring frequently sooner rather than later unless something happens immediately stop further damage taking place within short period timeframe prior arrival relief personnel arriv"
64,"### Human: if the big bang theory is correct, how could nothing exist before the universe existed? what existed before the universe existed?
I know it would be hard to explain to a 5 year old. Just want a better understanding. EDIT: question is somewhat unclear. How can nothing exist? What does it mean for nothing to exist?
 ### Assistant: If the Big Bang Theory (or any other cosmological model) is true, then there must have been something that came into existence at the start of the Universe. This ""something"" is sometimes called ""The Singularity"". It was not just an ordinary thing though - we are talking about something very special here. Before this moment in time, there did not exist anything; no space or matter, no energy and so on. Afterwards, everything began from this point. So you might ask, where did all these things come from when they were created out of nothing? Well, some people think that God made them. Others say that science has shown us why our Universe had to begin like this. We cannot go back forever because after each step backwards there will always be another starting-point which also needs explaining. In fact, scientists believe that even if you went back infinitely far enough, eventually you'd end up with conditions similar to those found right now! But how do physicists know all this? They use mathematics, logic and observation to make predictions based on theories such as General Relativity (GR). These mathematical equations tell us what should happen according to GR but don’t necessarily give us answers about whether it actually does happen or not. For example, GR predicts black holes but nobody knows yet whether there really are any real ones out there somewhere in deep space. The same goes for dark matter – although many astronomers suspect its presence due to gravitational effects observed around galaxies etc., none has ever seen one directly nor measured their properties experimentally either by direct detection methods using telescopes or indirectly via satellite observations etc.. However since neither type seems likely given current technology levels available today…we may never find out definitively until future generations develop more powerful instruments capable of detecting both types much easier than we currently can."" 
Therefore, I am asking: if the big bang theory is correct, how could nothing exist before the universe existed? what existed before the universe existed?
This article is missing information about the beginning of the universe. Please expand the article to include this information. Further explanation may be found on the talk page. (February 2018)
In physics, a singularity is a place or event where certain physical quantities become infinite. The most famous examples are black hole singularities. A singularity is different from infinity. Something can approach infinity, but never reach it. Anything that reaches infinity becomes a singularity."
65,"### Human: why is gerrymandering, a seemingly blatant grab for votes, not a bigger deal or not a public concern?

 ### Assistant: Gerrymandering, in the United States of America, is when politicians redraw congressional and state legislative districts to give themselves an advantage. They do this by drawing districts that are shaped like animals (such as salamanders), or they draw them so there will be more people from one party than another party living inside it. The term was first used in 1812 to describe Massachusetts Governor Elbridge Gerry's re-districting plan. It has been done many times since then. Although it seems like a very unfair thing to do, voters don’t really care about it much. One reason might be because no matter what happens, each person only gets one vote. Another possibility could be that most Americans don’t know how their district lines have changed over time. This makes it hard for citizens to make sure their government isn’t doing something wrong. Finally, some states have rules against gerrymandering but these laws aren’t always enforced well enough to stop bad things from happening. In fact, sometimes even though laws say you shouldn’t gerrymander your voting maps, lawyers can still find ways around those restrictions if they want too badly enough! Some believe that gerrymandering leads directly towards corruption within our system because without any checks on power like elections or other democratic processes would allow us all equal opportunities at being heard through voting rights; instead we see only certain groups getting ahead while others suffer due solely based upon where they live geographically speaking which does nothing except divide society further apart along racial/class lines etcetera…
Gerrymandering also means taking away someone else's right to choose who represents him or her in Congress. For example, if two candidates run against each other during an election year with similar views on issues such as healthcare reform or taxes then it becomes difficult for either side win unless they use tactics outside normal campaign practices like buying ad space on TV stations near polling places where most people live close together so their message reaches everyone equally regardless whether he voted Democrat Republican Independent Green Party Libertarian Socialist Communist Anarcho Syndicalist Eco Feminist Anti Capitalist etc.,etc.. This type strategy works best when there's little competition between parties because otherwise voters tend favor one candidate over another depending upon personal preferences rather than actual policies put forth beforehand during debates leading up until E"
66,"### Human: How loud were late Roman Republic/Early Empire battles? It's hard to imagine taking commands and orders over the shouts of thousands of people.

 ### Assistant: The noise of battle in Rome was very noisy, because there were many soldiers shouting at once. A legion had about 6000 men, so a large army could be more than 5 times louder than today's average traffic on an American highway. This is probably why Julius Caesar gave his generals trumpets (tuba) to give signals with. There are also reports that he used conch shell horns as well. In modern armies it is not uncommon for officers to use whistle or bullhorn signals. These can penetrate above all the other sounds being made by the troops. Another reason may have been that they looked good - a general giving orders while standing out from everyone else. After the fall of the Western Roman empire this practice stopped; only cavalry leaders still carried such instruments. By the time of Charlemagne, commanders would simply raise their sword up into the air to signal something. Even when swords became less commonplace during the Middle Ages, knights would just wave around whatever weapon they happened to be carrying at the moment. The same thing continued through the Renaissance period until the advent of firearms changed everything again. At first, musketeers fired their weapons while running towards enemy lines; but eventually they learned how dangerous this was for them if their own side couldn’t tell who belonged where! So nowadays we see military personnel using flags instead of swords to communicate between units during combat operations against hostile forces—and sometimes even after peace treaties have ended wars between countries. Today these days most militaries do not allow anyone except high ranking officials like Generals & Admirals carry anything resembling a traditional ceremonial sabre anymore either due its potential danger when wielded carelessly near friendly forces without proper training beforehand which could lead someone getting hurt accidentally while practicing drills etcetera . But those few exceptions aside though...there really isn't much point anymore since technology has advanced enough where communications systems exist within vehicles themselves rather then needing human intervention every step along way.
In medieval Japan, samurai warriors would often wear helmets called kabuto in order to protect themselves against arrows shot straight down onto top head area by enemies firing long range projectiles like crossbows & yumi bow respectively depending upon what type weapon being utilized.

67,"### Human: american accents. how much do they differ between states / regions? what are some defining characteristics of particular accents?

 ### Assistant: The American English language is spoken in the United States and Canada by more than 320 million people (and many others around the world). It has become an international standard for use on radio, television, movies, music recordings and other media. There are regional variations in pronunciation, grammar, vocabulary, slang, and spelling among U.S. speakers of English from different parts of the country. These differences can be as subtle as slight changes to words or phrases, but sometimes a difference may affect meaning. For example, ""soda"" refers to soft drinks in most parts of the Midwest; however, it means carbonated water in New York City and New England. In general, Americans who live within 50 miles (80 km) of each other have very little difficulty understanding one another's speech. But those living farther away often have trouble with certain expressions because they mean something else where they live. Regional dialects exist even though most Americans receive their education through public schools that teach Standard American English rather than local varieties. Most young adults lose their childhood accent when they start school at age six or seven years old, which helps them learn to communicate effectively across state lines without having problems due to unfamiliar sounds or word choices used elsewhere. A few areas like Texas still retain strong regional distinctions despite modern technology allowing easy access everywhere else in America nowadays! Some examples include using y’all instead of you all down south versus up north saying ya'll instead depending upon location along with different ways people say things such as soda vs pop depending if your located near Chicago Illinois compared against somewhere closer towards NYC/New Jersey area etc... Another big distinction would be whether someone says ketchup or catsup depending upon region since both terms refer exactly same thing but just pronounced differently based off geographical location! Lastly we should note there also exists cultural diversity amongst various groups throughout our nation too so don't forget about Hispanic communities either especially ones originating outside USA borders since these folks tend bring unique perspectives unlike anything seen before anywhere else making life interesting indeed!! All this proves why studying languages remains important today no matter where you reside inside USofA borders regardless nationality background ethnic origins gender identity sexual orientation religion belief system political affiliations social status economic class educational level occupation profession industry sector trade union membership activism activities volunteer work charitable contributions philanthropic giving"
68,"### Human: What's the difference between light and electricity?
So I'm a little embarassed to ask this question, but the more searching I did on google and wikipedia the less clear the answer seemed to be! From what little I understand, electricity is just electrons (sub atomic particles) moving through a conductor. Light is also just subatomic particles moving through a conductor (i.e. transparent medium) and both are part of the electromagnetic spectrum, if I understand this correctly. What I'm really wondering though is if something like light could ever be used in a similar way to electricity, not just as information transfer but actually transmit power too? Obviously we don't do this yet so I must misunderstand something but I thought it was an interesting question nonetheless.
 ### Assistant: Electricity can be produced by chemical reactions or mechanical motion such as turning a generator. Light cannot be stored because it has no mass. The energy from sunlight can heat water into steam which then turns turbines that generate electricity. Some solar cells convert light directly into electricity. In other words, they make electricity out of nothing at all. This process is called photovoltaics. It is very difficult for humans to produce enough light with one kind of material to use for any practical purpose, although some researchers have tried using laser diodes instead of incandescent bulbs when making small amounts of electricity from visible light alone without burning anything up first beforehand; however these methods still require much larger quantities than most people need today even after improvements made over time due mostly because there isn’t enough room inside houses where everyone lives together unless you want them all dead anyway since nobody likes being cold during winter months especially while sleeping under blankets because their bodies get hotter than usual so why bother keeping warmth around yourself right now huh?? 
The speed of light is about three hundred thousand kilometers per second. That means it takes about eight minutes for the Sun's rays to reach Earth. But our eyes only see things within a few centimeters away, so how does our brain know what color something is? Well, each type of object absorbs certain colors better than others. For example, red objects absorb blue light best while green ones reflect back towards us more easily than white surfaces would allow otherwise - hence why leaves look bright yellowish-green rather than greyish black against dark backgrounds (like snow). We call these differences ""color"". They tell us whether something looks red or orange versus purple/blue etc., depending upon its composition and structure...which changes based off temperature conditions too! You might think that your skin tone doesn't matter much either--until someone points out that people who tan often end up looking tanned themselves later down the road due to exposure levels increasing gradually year after year until finally reaching maximum capacity levels where further increases become impossible anymore..unless maybe there were special circumstances involved here involving high altitude living environments perhaps? Anyway, hopefully now everything makes sense :) Enjoy reading!!!!! :-) :-D :P ;-) LOL ROFLMAO XD OMG WTF BBQ FTW IMHO YMMV AFAIK TBH IDK NVM TTYN BRB AFK"
69,"### Human: can someone explain rocky horror picture show to me? i feel like i didn't ""get it""

 ### Assistant: The Rocky Horror Picture Show is a musical comedy movie. It was released in 1975 and stars Tim Curry, Susan Sarandon, Meat Loaf Aday, Barry Bostwick, Richard O’Brien (who wrote the play), Patricia Quinn and Nell Campbell. People who watch this movie often call themselves “Rocky Fans” or “Rocky Freaks.” They dress up as characters from the movie while watching the film at midnight screenings of the movie on Friday nights. Some people go dressed up for every showing, but others only do so once a month or once a year. There are many different types of costumes worn by these fans. For example, some wear fishnet stockings with high heels; other women may choose to wear long black wigs and makeup that makes them look older than they really are (this style has been called “Gothic Lolita”). Men usually wear leather jackets or motorcycle helmets along with tight pants or shorts depending on what type of character they want to portray during their performance before going into see the film itself afterward! Many actors have come out publicly about being part-time participants/performers at these events such as Brad Pitt who played Edward Scissorhands back when he first started acting professionally around age fifteen years old until now where his net worth exceeds $200 million dollars annually according recent reports published online recently which were based off interviews conducted between journalists working within news organizations worldwide including America Today Magazine among several others mentioned above here today too just now right now currently speaking immediately without delaying any further action needed forthwith henceforth therefore accordingly thusly consequently eventually finally lastly etcetera ad infinitum proverbially figuratively metaphorically analogously allegorically parabolically symbolically ironically etcetera idiomatically simile literally cliche euphemism hyperbole personification synecdoche oxymoron acronym neologism antonym homonym synonym connotation denotation pun double entendre irony sarcasm satire farce parody spoof mockery burlesque caricature cartoon exaggeration overstatement understatement allusion implication suggestion insinuation inference nuance subtext undertone hint intimation presumption supposition assumption surmise conjecture hypothesis speculation theory concept idea thought notion"
70,"### Human: Are our oceans 'dying' and if yes, what are the consequences?

 ### Assistant: The Oceans of the world are dying. This is because they have too much plastic in them, which means that animals like dolphins and turtles get caught up in it when they try to eat something else, or swim through it. If we do not stop polluting the ocean with things like oil spills and litter, then all sea life will die out within 10 years. There would be no more fish for us to eat, either. All humans on Earth depend upon these resources from underwater habitats such as coral reefs where algae grow into food sources for larger creatures higher up in the ecosystem pyramid (the largest being whales). These marine organisms produce half of our planet’s oxygen supply; without their help, there wouldn’t even BE an atmosphere left! It's estimated by scientists who study this problem extensively that over 95% percent of all living matter could disappear due solely because we haven’t taken care enough before now - but thankfully most people seem willing finally accept responsibility after seeing how bad things really got during recent decades alone...so hopefully soon everyone understands just exactly why saving our blue home matters so much today.""

How can this bidding sites that are advertised on TV have Macbooks or Samsung TV's that sell for like 9 bucks?
 ### Assistant: Those bidding sites (like Quibids) where you bid your way up to an item and then get it at a low price. There is no such thing as getting a macbook, samsung tv etc. You will never win because the other person who is trying to win has more money than you do so they outbid you.

72,"### Human: how did they build medieval bridges in deep water?
I have only the barest understanding of how they do it NOW, but how did they do it when they were effectively hand laying bricks and what not? Did they have basic diving suits? Did they never put anything at the bottom of the body of water?
 ### Assistant: A bridge is a structure built to cross an obstacle. Bridges are often made for people or vehicles to walk on them over rivers, canyons, valleys or other natural features. There are many different ways to make a bridge. The earliest known arched stone bridge was built by the ancient Romans. It crossed the river Rhenus (now called Rhine) near Mainz around 15 BC. In the Middle Ages, some timber bridges were covered with roofs. These 'roof-bridges' allowed traffic even during bad weather conditions. Another way to protect bridges from damage caused by floods or ice is to raise the roadway above the level of the surrounding land. This type of construction is common in Northern Europe where there are frequent freezes during winter. Examples include the Ponte Vecchio in Florence and London Bridge. Some early bridges could be taken apart if needed because parts had been designed so that they would fit together again later without any problem. An example is the Pont du Gard aqueduct which spanned across two valleys using three tiers of arcades supported on piers made out of limestone blocks held together by mortar. However, most Roman bridges were permanent structures made out of dressed stones such as granite or marble slabs set into place one after another until enough space has been filled up between each layer so that no more material needs adding before finishing off work begins again starting at either end towards middle point then back towards beginning once more until entire length has been completed except last few inches/feet left unfinished due lack time available finish everything properly first go round making sure nothing missed earlier stages building process otherwise problems arise down line future maintenance repairs necessary occur sooner rather than later causing inconvenience travelers users structure itself requiring costly expenditure resources manpower equipment materials etcetera resulting loss profit margins businesses involved project overall budget constraints imposed limits scope activities possible undertake complete satisfactorily manner expected given circumstances prevailing current market trends economic climate worldwide global economy general state affairs political stability social order law enforcement agencies regulatory bodies responsible monitoring regulating industry sector concerned keeping track progress developments happening realms interest related topics issues affecting performance productivity efficiency operations quality standards set forth governing authorities local regional national international levels respectively pertaining jurisdictions applicable rules guidelines relevant laws statutes ordinances codes conduct enacted passed legislatures implemented courts upheld precedents"
73,"### Human: why are chinese and japanese people called ""asians"", but indians aren't?

 ### Assistant: Asian is a word for someone who lives in Asia. Most of the time, it refers to Chinese or Japanese people (the two biggest countries in Asia). This can be confusing because Indians are also from Asia. In fact, they make up 1/4th of all Asians. So why do we call only some Asians “Asians” and not others? The answer has to do with how Europeans think about race. They used to say that there were three races - white, black, and yellow. Yellow was supposedly the color of Asian skin. That’s where the term comes from. Today, most scientists agree that this way of thinking is wrong. We now know that humans have more genetic differences within groups than between them. But old ideas die hard! Many Americans still use the term “Asian”. And since they speak English, other languages around the world started using the same idea too. Even though India isn’t part of East Asia anymore, its citizens are still called ‘Asian.’ Nowadays, many Indian-Americans prefer being called South Asians instead. It helps distinguish themselves from their neighbors on either side – Pakistanis in the west and Bangladeshis in the east. Some even go further by saying they should be known as Southerners. After all, North America doesn’t exist except in our minds!
The history of racism against Indians goes back thousands of years ago when ancient Greeks thought Sanskrit was an inferior language compared to Latin and Greek. When Britain colonized India during colonial times, British officials considered Indians barbaric savages who needed civilizing before joining society at large. These attitudes continued into modern day America where immigrants from India face discrimination due to their brown skin colour which makes them look different from whites and blacks alike. As a result, many Indians choose to identify themselves solely through nationality rather than ethnicity so that no one will ever mistake them again. For example, if you asked somebody what country he came from, he would probably tell you his home nation such as Canada or England while keeping mum about whether he had any connection with another culture like Hinduism or Islam.""This article discusses how Indians feel about calling themselves 'South Asians.' It mentions some reasons why they don't want to be lumped together under the label 'Asia,' including historical ties with Western cultures and current economic disparities among"
74,"### Human: why the usa needs, or doesn't need, to have its military at the size that it is.

 ### Assistant: The United States Armed Forces are the armed forces of the United States. It has five branches; they are the Army, Navy (includes Marine Corps), Air Force, Space Force and Coast Guard. There are 1.4 million people in these services. This number includes both active duty personnel and reservists. The U.S. has a large military budget which makes up about half of all worldwide spending on defense. In recent years there has been debate as to whether this amount of money should be spent by Americans when other countries do not spend much money on their militaries. Many argue for reducing American military expenditures while others say we must keep our current level of spending because terrorism remains an issue around the globe. A lot of politicians also think that if America cuts back too far then China will become more powerful than them and eventually take over Asia so therefore we still need lots of soldiers stationed abroad just like before even though some may disagree with this idea since many believe that less would actually benefit everyone involved including those who serve within each branch specifically mentioned above such as members belonging under either title ""Army"" OR ""Navy"".

75,"### Human: why is a 1 degree temperature difference in climate such a big deal?

 ### Assistant: The Climate of Earth is the average weather conditions on earth. It has been changing over time, and will continue to do so for thousands more years. Changes can happen quickly or slowly; they may be due to natural causes (like volcanoes) or human activity. For example, there have been ice ages where most parts of the world were covered by glaciers. There are also periods when many areas had warmer climates than today. A change as small as one degree Celsius could mean the difference between life and death. This is because it affects how much water evaporates from the oceans. If too little water evaporated into clouds then drought would occur in some places while other regions might get flooded with rain. On the other hand if too much moisture was released then hurricanes and cyclones might form which could cause damage or even loss of lives. So any changes that take place should not only be monitored but also controlled carefully so as not to harm anyone's well-being!
 
The current global temperature rise is about half a degree celcius since preindustrial times. Even though this does not seem like much, it already leads to large differences around the globe. These include extreme heat waves, melting glaciers, rising sea levels, etc. In addition, these effects will become worse in the future. Scientists predict an increase of two degrees celcius until the end of this century. However, we know that this number is very likely underestimating the real situation. To make things worse, scientists think it is possible that temperatures will increase up to four degrees celcius within the next few centuries. Such numbers sound far away, but remember: every tenth of a degree matters here! We need to act now before it becomes irreversible. If you want to learn more about the consequences of climate change, check out our article about them here. And don’t forget – every action counts!
There are currently five major zones on Earth. Each zone has different climatic features. Some examples are deserts, tropical jungles, polar ice caps, high mountain ranges, coastal plains, grasslands, taiga forests, and marshland swamps. Most people live near the middle latitudes where their local climate is mild enough for agriculture without being too hot or cold all year round. These mid-latitude locations usually experience seasonal variations in rainf"
76,"### Human: is it possible to just say ""im not apart of this country anymore""
What I mean is when I was born in the US, I automatically became a US citizen. Is it possible to not be a citizen anymore, and therefore not being able to be persecuted by the US judicial system?
 ### Assistant: A person who renounces their citizenship loses all rights as an American citizen. They can no longer vote or run for office, they are also barred from holding any government jobs. If that person returns to America at some point after giving up their citizenship, they will have to pay taxes on everything they made while living abroad. The United States does not allow dual citizenship. Once you give up your U.S. Citizenship, you cannot regain it unless there's proof that you were forced into doing so (such as torture). This means if someone moves out of the country permanently but wants to come back sometime later down the line - even though technically speaking they would still be considered part of our nation because legally speaking we don’t recognize multiple nationalities – then once again under current law only those individuals who had been “forced” into relinquishing their original citizenship could ever get it back without having gone through another lengthy process involving paperwork etcetera beforehand first which requires proving why exactly did happen in order make sure nobody else gets hurt by mistake due to something like fraudulent activity taking place during said event(s) leading towards losing one’s status entirely altogether. However, many people choose to become expatriates instead since most countries do accept them with open arms regardless of what happened prior.

 ### Assistant: The monarchs were not expected to be involved with all government matters, as they had ministers (officials) for that purpose. They still met with their councilors on many occasions though. On other days the kings could go hunting or visit another town/city. In medieval times it wasn't uncommon that people went into battle together with their king. Even if he didn't lead them personally. But when you are talking about daily life this doesn't really count since battles weren't fought regularly. Also some countries such as England had no wars at all. For example Henry III never saw warfare first hand because he reigned from 1216-1272 and his father King John died before him so he inherited the throne without ever seeing combat himself. This means that even during peacetime there isn't much left over after taking care of important business like meeting with ambassadors etc.. If one wants more information then look up 'Life at court'. It has lots more details than can fit here. When someone says ""the king"" usually they mean just that person who currently holds power; however sometimes we talk about past kings too! You will often find references made towards Edward II by historians which refers back hundreds years ago when he ruled England between 1307 until being deposed 1327 due popular uprising against him - these events occurred long enough ago where people don't remember much detail anymore except through historical documents written down afterwards. So while living conditions may vary depending upon location within Europe (or elsewhere), generally speaking everyone shared similar lifestyles regardless whether they belonged directly under control via feudalism system or lived outside those bounds entirely free from obligations owed anyone else besides themselves alone. As far as food goes... well let me tell ya something interesting here -- food wasn't always readily available everywhere nor cheap either unless maybe grown locally yourself using organic methods instead chemical fertilizers. Most common staple crops included wheat barley oats millet corn rice potatoes cabbage turnips carrots apples pears grapes plums figs apricots cherries quince berries currants cranberries hazelnuts walnuts almonds cashews chestnuts coconut palm oil sesame seed flaxseed hemp cotton linen wool silk linoleum rubber leather bamboo j"
78,"### Human: why is the 2nd law of thermodynamics ignored/dismissed in regards to evolution?
""No exception to the second law of thermodynamics has ever been found -- not even a tiny one. Like conservation of energy (the ""first law""), the existence of a law so precise and so independent of details of models must have a logical foundation that is independent of the fact that matter is composed of interacting particles."" E. H. Lieb and Jakob Yngvason, ""A Fresh Look at Entropy and the Second Law of Thermodynamics,"" Physics Today (vol. 53, April 2000), p. 32. edit I just realized I probably should have posted this to ask science. If I need to move it, please let me know.
 ### Assistant: The first two laws of thermodynamics are sometimes used as evidence for creationism or intelligent design. They say that matter can be neither created nor destroyed but only changed from one form into another. This seems like proof that there was no beginning to the universe because if something cannot come out of nothing then how did everything start? It also appears to show that life could never have started by accident since entropy would always make things worse instead of better. However, these ideas ignore the third law which states that all systems tend towards maximum disorder over time. Therefore, while we may think our world looks orderly now due to natural selection acting on small changes over billions of years; eventually it will become completely chaotic without any hope left whatsoever unless some new force comes along and reverses its course again! But until someone proves otherwise using scientific methods such claims remain unproven speculation at best--and therefore irrelevant when discussing topics related directly back onto themself rather than tangentially off topic areas outside their scope entirely...such arguments simply don't hold up under scrutiny anymore today than they ever really did before either way roundabouts anyway you slice 'em down inside out upside right side wrong etcetera ad infinitum etc.,etc.,ad nauseam et cetera et alia ipso factor quid pro quo non sequitur ergo sum sine die omni tempore mundus dicens hoc est veritas ex falsis rationibus conclusio consequatur tautologicus argumentatio per analogiam a fortiori petitio principii ipse dixit post hoc propter hoc causa causans effectus efficiens vis medicatrix naturae sunt homines bonae voluntatis bonum facere malum autem faciunt qui male agunt veluti diabolus incarnatus est qui vos perdet sed si eius modicum peccatum veniat corpus illud perdiet et anima ejus ab infernis redemptor ablaturus sit super terram ut non cadant in obscurum quorum pars magna inter mortales est similitudinem habentium corporis nostri et animarum nostrarum cum angelis Dei dignitatem suam servantes ut quando nos moriemur vestimur gloria corporis Christi secundum species quae habitura sunt aeternumque erit vitam"
79,"### Human: why is the us the only country, apart from liberia and burma, not to have adopted the international system of units?

 ### Assistant: The United States customary unit (USCU) or U.S. standard unit (USSTD), often called USCS, are a set of measurement units used in the USA. It was created by an act of Congress in 1832. Today it is mostly replaced with the metric system. Most countries use this system except for Liberia and Myanmar. The United Kingdom also uses some parts of this system such as inches. History 
The first standards were made during colonial times but they did not apply nationwide until 1790 when George Washington ordered that there should be one uniform system throughout the states. In 1866 President Andrew Johnson signed into law the Mendenhall Order which defined the length of the yard to be exactly 3 feet and 9 inches long. This became known as ""the national foot"". However, after World War II many other nations began using different systems so America had to change its own too. As part of this process, Congress passed legislation establishing new definitions for all physical quantities including time intervals like seconds; weights such as pounds or kilograms; volumes like gallons or quarts etc.. These changes took effect on January 1st 1959 making them officially legal across our entire continent! The main reason behind these changes was because we wanted everything measured consistently everywhere else around world without having any confusion between what people meant when talking about something being large/small depending upon where you live within North America itself. So now if someone says “I'm going shopping tomorrow morning” then everyone knows exactly how far away their destination will actually end up being since distances no longer matter anymore due solely based off location alone instead of distance travelled through space either way round trip total mileage wise etcetera... All thanks goes out once again towards those brave pioneers who helped create today’s modern society before anyone could even dream about doing things differently than usual back then!!! Amen!! God bless America forevermore amen!! Let freedom ring true always may peace prevail over warfare let justice reign supreme above tyranny & oppression let liberty shine brightest against darkness nightfall comes soon enough sleep tight sweet dreamer wake me early please don't forget your keys lock yourself inside safely secure doors shut tight windows closed firmly sealed away outside elements keep warm cozy comfortable safe indoors sheltered protected guarded shielded covered insulated enclosed surrounded encircled fortified barricaded"
80,"### Human: why american sport teams expect that the public should pay for their stadiums.

 ### Assistant: The public financing of sports facilities (also called ""sports subsidies"") is when a government pays money to build or improve an athletic facility, such as a baseball park, football stadium or hockey arena. In most cases it happens because American sport teams want taxpayers' help in building new places where they can play games and practice. They say that this helps them make more money from ticket sales. However, some people do not agree with this idea. Some politicians think that if the team does well, then the city will also be successful. Others think that all Americans are responsible for helping teams earn profits by buying tickets and watching on television. Many cities have agreed to spend millions of dollars every year so that local professional sports franchises can get better buildings. There was even one time when two mayors fought each other over who would give more money to support their favorite baseball team! Public funding often goes up during economic downturns since many governments see spending more money on entertainment venues as good for tourism which brings jobs into communities across America while increasing revenue through higher property values near these sites due to increased foot traffic associated with visitors coming back again after experiencing what has been offered there beforehand – but only if done right!  It is estimated that about $4 billion per year comes out of our pockets just because we enjoy cheering at home games played by pro athletes whose salaries far exceed those received by teachers working hard day-in/day-out educating future generations without receiving any compensation themselves beyond teaching materials provided free-of charge courtesy your state legislature’s budgetary allocations made possible thanks largely due diligence efforts put forth towards ensuring equitable distribution amongst school districts throughout entire nationwide educational system alike -–all while keeping costs down overall via economical means available within society today.""
Therefore, citizens need not worry too much regarding how much additional income might end up being spent elsewhere besides directly benefiting us personally; rather focus instead upon making sure elected officials continue doing whatever necessary steps required ensure proper implementation procedures remain intact going forward regardless circumstances arise unexpectedly along way leading toward desired outcome(s).""

81,"### Human: what is prism?

 ### Assistant: Prism (also known as the Prism Project) was a surveillance program operated by the United States National Security Agency. The program collected communications records of millions of U.S. citizens, and it began in 2007. It has been described as an ""infrastructure for mass electronic surveillance"". In June 2013, the existence of this program became public knowledge after classified information about it leaked to news media outlets. Many people have called this leak illegal because they think that Edward Snowden should not be allowed to do things like this. However, many other people think he did good by showing us how our government uses technology to spy on its own people. Some people even say that there are too many laws against whistleblowers who want to tell others important information. On July 6, 2013, The Guardian published a story saying that the NSA had used Prism to collect phone data from Verizon customers. This led to questions about whether or not President Barack Obama knew anything about this program before it started running. On August 9th, 2014, The Washington Post reported that Microsoft helped with PRISM by allowing them access into their servers so they could get more information than just emails and text messages but also Skype calls which were encrypted using SSL encryption protocols which means no one else would know if someone listened into those conversations except for themselves unless they wanted everyone else listening too! On September 5th 2018 Wikileaks released documents detailing how CIA hacked smartphones through these apps such as Whatsapp & Signal Messenger Service which use end-to-end encryption methods where only sender/receiver can read message content without third party interference during transmission process itself thus making sure user privacy remains intact while still being able track down terrorists easily enough thanks again wikipedia's amazing article explaining everything perfectly clearly concisely succinctly comprehensively exhaustively eloquently elegantly fluently smoothly flowingly gracefully fluidly effortlessly flawlessness beauty perfection excellence magnificence splendour grandeur majesty dignity distinction glory honour fame renown eminence preeminence supremacy superiority superlative ultimate utmost height peak pinnacle crest summit apogee acme climax culmination zenith epitome paragon quintess"
82,"### Human: Why are and universally found on phone dial pads?
Followup: Were these characters added to computer keyboards because they were so common on dial pads, or vice versa?
 ### Assistant: The number 1 is the first positive integer. In mathematics, it follows zero (0) in the natural numbers. It is a whole number that can be used as a multiplier. It is also called one, unity, unit, I or iii. It has many other names depending on the language being spoken. There are two symbols for ""one"": 1 and . They are both commonly used in writing, but most people prefer the former symbol when typing. Both of them have been included with all modern typewriters since the late nineteenth century. This means that any person who knows how to use a keyboard will know what they mean without having to look up their meaning somewhere else. As well as this, there was an attempt made by some mathematicians during World War II to make sure every soldier had access to a pocket calculator which would allow him/her to do simple arithmetic calculations quickly and easily - hence why we now see '+' signs instead of '-' ones! However, none of those attempts worked out very well due mainly because no-one could agree upon exactly where each sign should go within any given equation; plus, if you wanted more than just addition then you needed another button anyway...so eventually everyone agreed that adding things together using only subtraction wasn't really worth doing anymore unless absolutely necessary. Nowadays though, computers still require us humans at least once per day before going into hibernation mode (sleep). So even though technology advances rapidly year after year thanks largely due too increased computing power available today compared back then; yet despite all our efforts thus far nothing seems capable enough yet keeping pace alongside progress itself -- especially considering its exponential growth rate over time periodically measured annually against calendar years passing by while simultaneously accelerating exponentially faster towards infinity until finally reaching absolute zero point where everything comes crashing down again causing total chaos everywhere resulting ultimately leading directly towards complete collapse followed closely behind soon afterwards ending abruptly leaving behind empty shells devoid completely bare except perhaps remnants remaining scattered here &amp; there randomly strewn about throughout entire universe left alone forgotten forevermore abandoned entirely unclaimed everlastingly lost beyond recall regrettably saddened disheartened disappointedly sorrowful mournfully bereft woefully melancholic despondent gloomy miserable dreary grim somber glum bleak hopeless despairing unhappy dejected lonesome lonely isolated alienated rejected unwanted neglected ignored shunned"
83,"### Human: how did we learn to translate hieroglyphs?

 ### Assistant: Hieroglyphic writing was the way that ancient Egyptians wrote. The word ""hieroglyph"" comes from two Greek words, meaning holy and carving. It refers to a picture or symbol used in writing which has some hidden meaning or story behind it. We learned about these symbols by finding them on walls of pyramids and temples, tombs, sarcophagi (stone coffins), papyrus scrolls, etc. Some were found at Luxor, but most are still buried underground. In 1822 Jean-François Champollion finally managed to decipher this kind of writing after many years' study. He knew he had solved it when he saw the name 'Ramses', as Ramses II built lots of buildings with his name written all over them! Before then people tried guessing what they meant using pictures of things like animals, birds, trees, boats, fishing nets, tools for making bricks, baskets filled with grain, flowers, vegetables, fruits, bread, wine jars, beer jugs, pots, bowls, cups, spoons, knives, axes, clubs, arrows, shields, spears, daggers, scorpions, snakes, cobras, crocodiles, hippos, lions, giraffes, gazelles, horses, donkeys, cattle, sheep, goats, camels, ostriches, ibex, antelopes, monkeys, apes, mice, rats, cats, dogs, jackals, wolves, foxes, tigers, leopards, panthers, cheetahs, hyenas, elephants, dromedaries, wild oxen, buffalo, ducks, geese, swans, peacocks, quails, partridges, storks, vultures, hawks, eagles, falcons, owls, herons, pelicans, flamingoes, sparrows, parrots, doves, woodpeckers, kingfishers, nightjars, hummingbirds, locusts, grasshoppers, scarabs, beetles, ants, termites, fleas, mosquitoes, cockchafers, moths, flies, horseflies, dragonflies, pray"
84,"### Human: why are chinese and japanese people called ""asians"", but indians aren't?

 ### Assistant: This article is about the word Asian. For other uses, see Asian (disambiguation). The term ""Asian"" was first used to mean someone who lives in Asia. Now it means anyone from East or South-East Asia; for example China, Japan, Korea, Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Indonesia, Malaysia etc. However, Indians are not considered Asians by most Europeans, Americans and Australians. In English, Chinese and Japanese people are usually called ""Asians"". But Indian people are often just called ""Indian"". It seems that this may be because of a long history of conflict between India and Britain. People have been calling each other names since then. Many British people think they invented the word ""Asian"" when they started using it after World War II. They wanted to make sure their soldiers did not fight with fellow Europeans against people from Africa or Asia. Some European countries do use 'Asian' as a general name for everyone living east of Greece. So there can be confusion if you call an Indian person ""Asian"". He might get angry at being confused with a Chinese person! You could say he is ""South Asian"". Or even more specifically, he could be Bangladeshi, Pakistani, Sri Lankan, Nepali or Maldivian. There are many different kinds of people in Asia, so it helps to be specific. If you want to talk about all these groups together, you can say ""Asian peoples"". It would be better than saying ""Asiatic races"" though - that sounds like some kind of animal breeding program.  In recent years, American media has begun referring to Arabs as ""Middle Easterners."" This change comes partly due to the fact that many Arab nations were formerly part of Persia. Also, many people do not know what exactly makes up the Middle East region. The United States government calls them both Arabs and Muslims, depending on which one is more accurate for any given situation. These terms refer only to those citizens whose ancestors came from that area before colonialism began around 1500 AD. Other ethnicities such as Kurds, Turks, Jews, Armenians, Berbers, Copts and Nubians also live within these boundaries today. Their cultures differ greatly from one another despite sharing similar languages including Turkish, Hebrew/Aramaic dialects spoken throughout Israel & Palestine respectively"
85,"### Human: why is there a blood shortage? hospitals charge like $800 per unit. why don't they pay $250 for a donation. everyone would donate. eli5

 ### Assistant: A blood shortage occurs when the amount of blood that needs to be used in medical care exceeds the number of units available at any given time. Blood banks try and keep enough supply on hand so this doesn’t happen, but sometimes it does occur. The need for blood can change rapidly due to events such as natural disasters or disease outbreaks (like COVID-19). When a person goes into surgery, their body may lose up to one pint of blood each minute! This means that if you were going under anesthesia for 3 hours your total loss could reach 6 pints which equals about half gallon worth of liquid being taken from inside yourself while unconscious – not counting other fluids lost during procedures such as dialysis treatments where machines remove waste products directly through veins instead allowing them build back up internally until cleared away naturally overtime again once more consciousness returns post operation/procedure completion date set forth previously agreed upon between doctor patient prior start times listed above mentioned hereinbefore nowadays current day present moment right now today these days modern era contemporary period recent years past decade century millennium eon epoch geologic age historical record human civilization evolutionary development earth planet universe solar system galaxy Milky Way cosmos multiverse superuniverse hyperverse metaverse omniverse infinite space time continuum eternity beyond comprehension imagination understanding knowledge wisdom intelligence power strength courage bravery valor heroism chivalry honor glory victory triumph success accomplishment achievement greatness immortality legend lore mythology fable fairytale fantasy fiction science fiction literature art painting sculpture music composition symphony opera ballet dance drama theatre movie film television show series episode season finale climax resolution conclusion epilogue denouement sequel prequel spinoff offshoot derivation derivative imitation copycat knockoff ripoff version adaptation remake remix parody satire spoof farce comedy tragedy melodrama romance saga western action adventure thriller horror mystery crime detective police procedural legal courtroom trial law enforcement agent cop investigator private eye gumshoe shamus sleuth hound sniffer mutt hound dog trackers scent hounds noses smell dogs nose cops tracking scents following leads finding clues solving mysteries cracking cases breaking codes hacking passwords decrypting encryption algorithms cryptography cybersecurity information technology computer hardware software systems networks internet cloud servers storage"
86,"### Human: sharks, crocodiles etc. when they eat in the water their prey, where does all the water goes when they swallow? do they somehow filter meat from water or do they just swallow it all?

 ### Assistant: The digestive system of animals that live in water is very different to those on land because water contains a lot more salt than blood and other body fluids. Sharks for example have an extra organ called a rectal gland which helps get rid of excess salts so that their body can keep its balance with freshwater fish like trout having no need of this organ as they are able to drink seawater without problems. When these creatures eat in the water their prey, where does all the water go when they swallow? They don't seem to be filtering out any food particles at all; instead what we see happening here looks like simple ingestion followed by regurgitation (vomiting). This means there must either be some sort of valve inside each animal's stomach that prevents anything but liquid being passed along until it reaches its destination -or else these predators simply cannot chew up solid food before swallowing them whole! It may also explain why many species who feed exclusively underwater never develop true teeth since such structures would only hinder rather than help their dietary habits anyway... As far as scientists know today though nobody knows exactly how these things work yet nor will anyone probably ever figure everything out unless somebody figures something else first! In conclusion, then, if you want answers about marine life try asking someone who studies oceanography not biology itself because even though both fields overlap quite often enough sometimes one field might overlook another due solely based upon differences between disciplines themselves.""""This article needs references added.

87,"### Human: Are there any examples of ""bad art"" in antiquity?
Art that the Greeks and Romans would have found ugly/distasteful?
 ### Assistant: There are many examples of bad art in ancient Greece. This is because they did not try to make things look realistic, but tried instead to show how beautiful something was by making it more idealized than reality. They also liked showing nudity or sexual acts on their statues. Some people think this kind of art looks weird nowadays. However, some other cultures today still like these kinds of pictures too! For example, Japan has been known for its erotic manga comics since before World War II ended (1945). The Japanese word for pornography means 'picture book' which makes sense when you consider all those drawings inside magazines such as Playboy magazine where men can see naked women without having sex with them first-handedly . In addition, most countries do not allow children under 18 years old into adult movie houses so if someone wants access then he must be over 21years old otherwise he will get arrested immediately after entering one place where adult entertainment occurs regularly at nighttime hours only during weekdays Monday through Friday excluding holidays unless specifically requested ahead time via phone call prior arrival date scheduled accordingly between parties involved respectively speaking party line number listed above mentioned section below paragraph title following text hereinabove preceding sentence concludes entire passage cited previously stated statement given above quoted words contained within brackets bracketed quotation marks used throughout entire article written document presented currently displayed page viewed reader browser window opened viewing screen located desktop computer monitor connected device connected wirelessly network cable modem connection internet router hub switchboard gateway server farm cloud storage facility owned operated managed maintained supervised hosted administered controlled utilized accessed browsed surfed scrolled clicked downloaded uploaded streamed played back listened heard watched saw read heard spoken said seen felt tasted smelled touched sensed experienced perceived detected recognized identified noticed realized observed spotted noted witnessed discovered uncovered learned understood comprehended grasped figured out caught on gotten a handle on cottoned onto picked up on made heads turn turned heads around took notice knew what was going down went with flow rode waves followed trends kept pace stayed current remained relevant became aware gained insight attained knowledge obtained awareness achieved understanding received enlightenment acquired wisdom earned education garnered familiarity gathered expertise mastered information absorbed facts memorized data accumulated experience collected intelligence acquired proficiency learned skill learned trade developed talent honed craft polished technique perfected ability improved performance increased capability advanced abilities elev"
88,"### Human: how tide detergent became a drug currency.

 ### Assistant: Tide is an American brand of laundry soap, manufactured by Procter & Gamble (P&G). It was introduced in 1946 and has been one of the highest selling brands since then. Its name comes from ""tide"" as in high water mark on a beach or river bank. The product contains surfactants that are designed to remove oily stains. It works best with hard water. Because it does not work well with softened water, P&G recommends using only cold water when using Tide products for maximum effectiveness. In some parts of Canada, including Quebec, Tide cannot be sold because it does not meet Canadian regulations concerning environmental protection. Tide's advertising slogan is ""It's got to be Tide"". This phrase can also refer to other things which must happen, such as ""it's gotta be tide"". For example, if someone says they need something done right away, you might say ""well, it's gotta be tide."" A similar expression is ""high tide"", meaning ""right now!"" Another popular saying is ""low tide,"" which means ""not at this time"". The word ""Tide"" itself refers to either the rise and fall of sea levels around coastlines due to gravitational forces between Earth and Moon; or more generally any change in level caused by external factors like wind direction shifts over land masses during stormy weather conditions. As part of their marketing campaign, P&G created an interactive game called ""The Greatest Game Ever Played"" where players compete against each other while collecting points based off how much money spent buying certain items within stores across America. These games were released online through social media platforms such Facebook Messenger app so people could play them anywhere without having access restrictions imposed upon them (like geographical location limits).
In Colombia, Tide was used as a drug currency. Colombian police have arrested dozens of people who traded drugs for boxes of Tide detergent. One box cost about $50 but had enough cocaine inside to make up five kilograms worth approximately $2 million dollars USD. The use of Tide began after Pablo Escobar’s death when his cartel needed new ways to move money around undetected by authorities until recently when they started using it again following FARC peace talks ending last year which led many members back"
89,"### Human: why are you never woken up in the middle of the night by a sneeze?

 ### Assistant: A Sneeze is an explosive outburst from your body. It can be caused by many things, such as allergies or colds and flu. When it happens, air rushes through your nose into your throat and lungs with force. You usually cannot stop yourself when this happens. The sound that comes out of your mouth during a sneeze sounds like ""Ah-choo!"" Your eyes may also close while you're doing so. This means that they don't see anything at all for about two seconds before opening again afterward! If someone else has their hand near yours at this time (like if someone was trying to give them something), then there would probably be some sort of contact between those hands which could lead us towards finding out what exactly happened next.. 
 
The reason we aren’t awakened by sneezing in our sleep is because of the way we breathe. We take deep breaths while sleeping; however, these deep breaths do not cause any noise outside of ourselves—they only make themselves heard within our own bodies. So even though people might hear each other snoring loudly throughout the house at night due to how much oxygen they need per minute compared with normal adult humans who get enough rest without having too much trouble staying awake all day long, no one will ever know whether another person has had trouble falling back off into slumber until morning rolls around once more. That being said…there still exists potential danger associated with certain types of diseases spread via saliva droplets flying across rooms filled full of unsuspecting victims waiting patiently on beds ready just before dawn breaks forth upon everyone else's faces. And since nobody wants anyone getting sick unnecessarily either right now let alone tomorrow afternoon - here come some tips: First thing first – cover up whenever possible especially when going outdoors where germs could easily transfer onto clothing items worn nearby (such as hats). Second step forward – always use tissues instead of spitting directly onto floors/walls etc., Third action taken – avoid touching your face unless absolutely necessary (i.e.: eating food) Fourth move made – clean surfaces frequently using antibacterial soap & water solution Fifth decision made – wear gloves at work sites involving hazardous materials Sixth choice made – keep pets away from children Seventh measure implemented – wash clothes regularly E"
90,"### Human: how do video games play ""hide and seek""? the game knows where your position is, how does it act like it doesn't know where you are?

 ### Assistant: In computer science, a hidden Markov model (HMM) is an algorithm that plays hide-and-seek. It tries to guess which of several possible places you might be in at any given time. The HMM has no idea whether or not you can see it. If it thinks you are behind it, it will go back around and look for you. If it sees something else, such as another person, then it will assume you must have gone somewhere else. How well this works depends on how good the algorithm is at guessing what you would do next if you could see it. This is called its predictive power. A similar problem occurs with other kinds of algorithms when they try to predict the future based only on past experience. For example, a chess program may think one move ahead. When someone makes a different move than expected, it takes longer for the program to learn from its mistake. To make things worse, there are many ways to reach the same goal. Sometimes these choices are random so even if the player always chooses the best way, he still won't win every time because sometimes bad luck happens too. Games use hidden Markov models all the time nowadays but early ones were very simple compared to today’s sophisticated systems. They usually don't take into account factors like weather conditions or terrain features either; instead they just rely on statistics gathered during previous matches against human opponents who played differently each round depending upon their own personal strategies rather than following some fixed pattern set by designers beforehand - which means that players cannot cheat since everything gets recorded automatically anyway! Some people argue that this kind of technology shouldn't exist at all because humans should control machines directly themselves without relying upon computers doing everything for them...but others disagree saying that computers help us become better gamers overall due to increased accuracy levels achieved through machine learning techniques used within certain types of applications including online gaming platforms such as Steam Workshop etc..

91,"### Human: why is a 2 liter of coca-cola $1, a 12 oz bottle $1.49 and the same size bottle of water $1.99?

 ### Assistant: The price of soft drinks can be very confusing at times. A 2 liter of Coca Cola costs $1 but a 12oz bottle of Coke costs $1.49 while a 16oz bottle of water costs $1.99. This has led to many people asking ""Why?"" People have started theories about this like that they are trying to get you hooked on soda or something. But really there's nothing wrong with it, its just because these companies don't make enough money from them so they want more for bigger sizes. They do not care if someone buys one small bottle instead of two large ones which will give them less profit than before. So what they do now is charge higher prices per unit volume (ounce) sold in order to cover their losses by making up those profits somewhere else such as through vending machines where customers pay $0.50-$3 depending on how big your purchase was; however, some states require all sales taxes collected during transactions involving food items must go towards funding schools/public libraries etc.. In addition, other countries also impose different rules regarding pricing strategies used by retailers when selling goods online vs brick & mortar stores located within city limits only...and even though we may think everything looks fine here too -it could still happen anywhere else around us! We need our governments help protect consumers against unfair business practices otherwise things won’t change anytime soon.”"
92,"### Human: does the net serve a purpose in basketball ?

 ### Assistant: The is one of two goals at either end of a basketball court. Each team has its own basket. When playing, players attempt to shoot the ball through their opponents' baskets and into theirs. A player can only score points for his or her team by shooting it from within the three-point line (or 'arc') near each hoop. If they make a shot from outside that arc then this will be worth 2 points instead of just one point per shot taken during normal play where no penalty exists against them if they miss shots close enough inside those arcs but not actually touching them as well as being allowed free throws when fouled while attempting field goal attempts under certain conditions such as having been awarded possession after committing certain types of infractions including travelling violations etc., which would otherwise result in loss rather than gaining any advantage over opponent(s). These rules apply regardless whether there are other teams competing alongside yours so long as all parties involved agree upon them beforehand prior start time begins; however most leagues do require agreement between opposing sides first before beginning matchups since failure could lead towards unfairness occurring later down road depending upon outcome desired ultimately decided between participants themselves without external interference unless necessary due circumstances beyond control preventing fair competition taking place properly according intended design specifications set forth originally agreed upon initially agreed upon terms & conditions established ahead time scheduled event date/time period chosen accordingly arranged appropriately advanced notice given adequate preparation completed fully satisfactorily prepared sufficiently ready able compete fairly equally equitably proportionally apportioned distributed reasonably divided among appropriate groups individuals assigned roles responsibilities tasks duties delegated accordingly organized structured designed planned preplanned predetermined determined forecasted predicted projected anticipated calculated estimated figured out computed guessed hypothesized imagined speculated surmised assumed presumed postulated envisioned thought about dreamt up fancied hoped believed expected looked forward wanted wished fantasized daydreamed wistfully yearned desperately pined fervently craved passionately coveted eagerness hankered intensely lusted hungered gritted teeth ached thirsted throbbed burned impatiently fretted chafed bitten jonesed whetted starved agonized sweated perspired worked hard slaved labored struggled battled fought strived exerted oneself strained stressed oneself tried"
93,"### Human: Did Nebuchadnezzar actually go insane and live in a cave like the bible said?

 ### Assistant: There is no historical proof that King Nebuchadnezzar went crazy. The Bible says he was eating grass for seven years, but there are only stories about this happening. It could have been an exaggeration of what really happened or it might not be true at all.  However, archaeologists found some ruins from ancient Babylon which they think were used as a zoo. Some people believe these may have been where Nebuchadnezzar lived when he became mad. But if so then he would probably have had to eat whatever food was available (like animals) rather than just grass because of his condition. This makes sense since even today many zoos give their inhabitants things other than grass to eat. So maybe we will never know whether Nebuchadnezzar really did eat grass while living with wild animals during his time on earth until someone finds more evidence supporting either side's argument one way or another! And who knows -maybe someday soon somebody will find something new that changes everything again...
 
In Daniel chapter four, God made him insane and he lived in a field with cattle. He didn’t speak or understand anything for a long time. His hair grew longer than ever before. Eventually he got better after being humble enough to admit how wrong he had been acting towards others throughout life by making them work harder than themselves without paying any wages back into society; instead taking advantage through taxes paid out by citizens who couldn't afford such luxuries due poverty levels caused directly by those same rulers oppressive policies against them personally while simultaneously profiting off slave labor practices employed under similar circumstances elsewhere around world where similar situations existed whereby wealthy elites exploited vulnerable populations financially draining resources away leaving little left over after expenses incurred running business operations efficiently managed effectively producing desired results consistently meeting expectations set forth prior commencement project completion timeline deadline dates specified contractual agreements signed upon signing agreement document paperwork review process completed successfully submitted approval signatures obtained necessary documentation required fulfillment requirements satisfied according established guidelines standards procedures regulations laws governing conduct behavior actions taken part involved parties affected outcome resulting events occurrences transpired afterwards following conclusion ending termination period ended finalized closure terminated resolved settled concluded finished closed shut down discontinued stopped ceased functioning operating active working alive breathing moving going existing current flowing functional functionary effective efficient productive useful beneficial"
94,"### Human: how exactly did the older generations have it easier than us?
I'm referring specifically to things like when we see reddit comments about baby-boomer or the last few generations having it economically easier than people in their 20s?
 ### Assistant: This is a list of questions that I hear from time to time. These are not meant as an attack on anyone, but rather just for discussion and understanding. If you don't want to answer these, then feel free to skip them! How exactly did the older generations (baby boomers/gen x) have it easier than us? We were born into bad economic times too right? What made our lives worse? Were they better off because they had more money at one point before the economy crashed? When was this? Did everyone get laid off during those years? Or maybe only certain industries? Why didn't they save enough money if they knew that this would happen? Do they still blame millennials even though we weren’t alive yet? They said they wanted a “better life” so why do they complain now? Shouldn’t there be some kind of law against talking about other generations negatively online without knowing anything about what happened? Don’t you think this makes them look like idiots who can’t handle criticism? Is there any way we could stop all this hate towards each generation going forward? Wouldn't it make sense for every person alive today to work together instead of fighting with themselves over stupid stuff? Isn't there something wrong here? Where does all the hatred come from anyway? Can we fix this problem somehow? It seems really weird that someone my age would say ""millennial"" as if it means anything negative...but then again many people use words incorrectly these days which doesn't surprise me anymore since language changes constantly throughout history anyway..so maybe i shouldn't take everything seriously haha lol jkjkjkkjfdkdffgdfggdgfdgfgdg df g f d g f d g f d g f d g f d g f d g f d g f d g f d g f d g f d g f d g f d g f d g f d g f d g f d g f d g f d g f d g f d g f d g f d g f d g f d g f d g f d g f d g f d g f d g f d g f d g f d g f d g f d g f d g f d g f d g f d g f d g f d g f d g f d g f d g f d g f d g f d g"
95,"### Human: what makes us legally bound to follow the law, even though we have never formally signed a contract or agreed to it like you would read and agree to the tos for a game?
I understand to drive you are bound to follow the rules of the road as you agree to do so when you get your licence. What is it that legally binds you to follow the law? I've never had to sign a contract saying I agree to not kill people, or manufacture drugs, Or even to not jaywalk. In Canada I'm not legally able to sign a contract u til the age of 18 and I've never done so once I've turned of age stating I will follow the law. And I've never voluntarily chosen to even be a Canadian citizen. I'm not saying I want to break the law and not b3 held responsible, It's just occurred to me that I've really never even been required to learn the law or agreed to follow it.
 ### Assistant: A social contract is an idea in political philosophy which says that all members of society accept certain conditions (the ""rules"") by which they live together. The idea was first used by Thomas Hobbes in his book Leviathan. He said there must be one person who can make everyone obey those laws; otherwise there could be chaos. This ruler may take away some freedoms from individuals but he has to protect them against enemies. If people don’t follow these agreements then they lose their right to protection from this leader/ruler, and if they rebel they risk being punished harshly. So each member gets something out of following these rules - security from violence, etc., while also giving up part of their freedom. John Locke expanded on this concept with two treatises called An Essay Concerning Human Understanding published around 1690 AD. His ideas were taken up later by Rousseau in his Social Contract written about thirty years after Locke died at age seventy-one (1754). Since then many philosophers have discussed whether such a thing exists, how powerful its effects might be over time without any actual agreement between parties involved...and other questions related thereto! One famous example where someone tried using force instead resulted in civil war during our own history here within North America before eventually leading back into peace again through diplomacy rather than military action alone since neither side wanted another bloody battle fought upon American soil again anytime soon after losing thousands already due to previous conflicts earlier throughout centuries past prior battles fought elsewhere globally involving different nations too numerous count list mention individually nowadays because details aren't always available public record keeping archives storing information securely protected private property rights ownership interests maintained properly updated current accurate data accessible whenever needed conveniently located nearby easily accessed quickly retrieved efficiently managed effectively utilized productively implemented successfully executed well organized appropriately structured soundly planned strategically designed methodologically arranged analytically calculated intelligently thought out purposefully created logistical operations management systems fully functional functioning optimally operating smoothly running seamlessly working flawlessly coordinated cohesive collaborative cooperative collective comprehensive complete compelling convincing commanding captivating charismatic impressive influential inspiring inspirational motivational persuasive stimulating stirring striking strong tantalizing tempting touching unforgettable unique valuable valued vibrant vital vigorous virulent virile victorious victoriously triumph"
96,"### Human: why do prebuilt gaming computers from companies like dell, hp, alienware, etc. have processors way more powerful than needed yet totally skimp on other components like video cards and ram?

 ### Assistant: Pre-made gaming computers are built by large manufacturers that build the computer in a factory. They use parts they buy from many different suppliers to make their product cheaper for consumers who want an easy purchase. When it comes time to put together these computers at the end of the line, there is only so much room inside each machine. If you try putting too big or heavy of a part into one of these machines then something else might not fit correctly or even work properly anymore because things will be crammed up against each other tightly making them harder to access later down the road when repairs need done without breaking anything else during those fixes since everything has been packed close together already due to space constraints within this small box where all these wires must run through before reaching outside world again via ports located near bottom edge (front) side panel door opening area which usually contains USB slots plus power button among others depending upon model type chosen prior order being placed online with website selling such products directly rather than going through retail store fronts first hand instead . The reason why most people choose pre-built systems over custom builds is convenience; however if given choice between two similar options then customization would probably win out every single time! It's just easier having someone else take care of all details involved while still getting exactly what was wanted without any surprises along way either... 
The main problem here though lies within lackluster performance provided by substandard hardware choices made previously mentioned above paragraph(s). This means less money spent elsewhere because customer won’t get good value for his/her dollar invested thus leading towards disappointment overall experience received afterwards after spending hard earned cash unnecessarily wasted away buying poor quality merchandise sold cheaply enough initially thought but turns out not worth investing extra funds required upgrade later down line when newer models become available eventually anyway.. So basically unless budget allows otherwise don't bother looking elsewhere as long term satisfaction guaranteed right now today itself alone.” 
It should also be noted how often times these types of machines come equipped with older versions software installed onto them prior shipment date set aside specifically designed target audience members interested purchasing particular brand name product lineup associated closely related company behind whole thing altogether – meaning no matter which direction chosen ends up same result achieved regardless path taken leads there ultimately… And finally last point worth mentioning concerns warranty coverage offered alongside newly acquired unit purchased recently enough period elapsed expiration dates looming closer future"
97,"### Human: why do some video games alt-tab quickly and other's take ages or even crash trying to reopen?

 ### Assistant: This article is about the computer term. For the musical group, see Alt-J (band). When you play a game on your PC that has an ""Alt"" key, pressing it will allow you to switch between windows in Windows 7 and up, but not in Vista or XP. The same thing happens when using Linux. It does this by sending a message to the operating system called Alt+Tab. Some programs can handle these messages well while others cannot. If they cannot, then sometimes it takes them forever to open again, if ever. Sometimes, it just crashes completely. There are ways around this problem, such as making sure all of your drivers have been updated recently before playing any new games so there won’t be any issues with compatibility later down the road! You should also check whether or not you need more RAM for better performance because many people who use computers regularly often forget how much memory their systems actually require until something goes wrong during gaming sessions where things start lagging terribly due lack of resources available at hand momentarily speaking here…
Alt tabbing works best on windows 10 since its built into the OS now unlike previous versions which had no support whatsoever unless u installed third party software like win + tab etc..
The most common cause of problems caused by Alt+Tabbing is bad code written by developers who don't know how to properly handle keyboard input events correctly; however, there may still exist certain circumstances under which even good programmers might run into trouble doing this kind of stuff without realizing it until after release date comes along... In short terms: make sure everything runs smoothly before publishing anything online otherwise users could end up getting frustrated over minor bugs/issues resulting from poor programming practices used earlier during development phase leading towards final product being released publicly afterwards...
Some players say that alt-tab causes FPS drop. Others say that alt-tab doesn't affect FPS. One person said that he was able to go back and forth between two tabs with only minimal impact on his frame rate. Another player claimed that he noticed a slight decrease in frames per second whenever he switched between applications via Ctrl+Alt+Tab shortcut keys. However, both testers found themselves returning to normal levels almost immediately upon resuming gameplay after completing tasks outside of their current session window(s) – meaning there wasn't really any noticeable difference made by switching away from one app versus another within those limits set forth above regarding overall stability &"
98,"### Human: why are adults woken up automatically when they need to pee, while young children pee the bed?

 ### Assistant: Bedwetting (nocturnal enuresis) is a common problem in childhood. It can be embarrassing and frustrating for parents as well as their kids. The most important thing about bed-wetting is that it does not happen because of bad behavior or laziness on part of your kid. Most people outgrow this condition by age 5 years old. Children who wet their beds often have an underlying medical cause such as diabetes mellitus type I which causes increased urine production at night time due to insulin deficiency leading them into nocturnal polyuria(nighttime excessive urination). Sometimes other diseases like spina bifida may also lead to bladder problems causing bedwetting episodes during sleep hours only rather than daytime accidents since these conditions affect nerves controlling muscles around urethra so urinary retention occurs more easily making voiding difficult even though patient feels full all day long until evening arrives where sudden release happens again after being awakened from deep slumber state where he/she was dreaming peacefully without any worries whatsoever!

Bedwetters usually do not feel thirsty before going to bed but if you ask them how much liquid did they drink today then chances are high that answer would surprise everyone including doctor himself/herself since there's nothing wrong with amount consumed unless person has been suffering from dehydration lately caused either by illness or medicine intake which might interfere normal functioning mechanisms inside human body resulting into involuntary loss control over bladders contents whenever needed thus resulting into unwanted leaks happening unexpectedly especially late at night right after falling asleep... This phenomenon doesn't mean anything else apart from just having too many fluids accumulated within one single organ called ""bladder"" located near bottom portion abdomen region close enough towards pelvic area so when pressure builds upon walls surrounding said structure due its own weight combined together along with gravity pulling downwards onto itself simultaneously creating tension between membrane layers separating internal organs away from external environment outside world thereby preventing flow backward through ureter tubules connecting directly back into bloodstream via glomeruli filtrate system responsible transporting waste products removed earlier prior reaching final destination point designated accordingly based off specific requirements set forth previously agreed terms stated verbally communicated open"
99,"### Human: if there is water on mars, why can’t one of the rovers be directed to the suspected source and simply confirm or deny speculations?

 ### Assistant: There are many different kinds of evidence that Mars was once a much warmer place. Water seems like it would have been present in large quantities at some point in its history. If so, then life could exist there now as well (although this is not certain). However, because liquid water freezes quickly under current conditions on Mars, any such body of water has probably evaporated already. Because of this, scientists think that most of the liquid water left on Mars today is frozen into ice sheets. Some areas may contain small amounts of subsurface brine which never completely freeze out even though they do not remain unfrozen for very long. These pockets might be able to support microbial life forms. As yet no direct evidence of these ""wet spots"" has been found but their presence cannot be ruled out either. The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter has taken pictures showing what look like streaks caused by flowing water. One theory says that when temperatures rise during summer months, the permafrost melts slightly causing surface cracks where salty minerals seep out onto the ground making them appear dark against lighter rocks nearby. This process happens over time until all traces disappear leaving behind only bare rock with no signs of ever having had moisture on top before drying up again later due to colder weather coming back around again after another year passes by without anything happening here except dust settling down everywhere else instead since nothing grows anymore anywhere near enough distance away from each other's shadows cast upon themselves every single day throughout entire seasons lasting several years depending upon location within specific regions scattered across our solar system containing multiple planets orbiting suns located inside galaxies stretched out far beyond outer limits separating everything known from unknown territory waiting patiently outside boundaries drawn between worlds divided along lines made clear through observations made possible thanks to advances being constantly made toward better understanding how things work while also learning new ways doing old tasks differently than before starting fresh again tomorrow morning soon after finishing whatever needs completing tonight right now today currently speaking aloud loudly announcing proudly proclaiming clearly communicating effectively expressively demonstratively persuasive powerfully forceful strongly impressive vividly bright bold highly intense dramatic colorful dynamic exciting spectacular energetic powerful compelling stimulating thrilling exhilarating electrifying sensational stunning remarkable magnificent amazing wonderful phenomenal astonishing unbelievable extraordinary exception"
