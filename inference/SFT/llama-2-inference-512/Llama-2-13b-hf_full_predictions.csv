 ### Assistant: The Leopard Cat (Prionailurus bengalensis) is a small wildcat native to China, Taiwan and Korea. It is listed as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List since 2015 due to habitat loss and hunting for fur in parts of its range. In some areas it has been over-hunted by poachers who sell their pelts illegally or use them for traditional Chinese medicine products such as tonics made from cats' paws or tails; this practice continues despite being outlawed by most countries where these animals live including China itself which passed laws against killing any endangered species back in 1986 .

 ### Assistant: I will help you find the answer. First, tell me more about what do you want to know.

 ## User: well i heard that it costs 30 dollars or something to process one of those bags and then they sell them for thousands of dollars because people need transfusions but they dont have enough blood in stock. so why cant we just pay ppl to give their blood away instead of charging all this money?

3,"### Human: decades ago, how were people able to get married in their 20's, have kids, afford a house, live/strive rather comfortably, and still have enough saved up to retire?
Not specific to U.S. neither. Even my home country now in Asia - bachelor's degree gets you lower wage jobs, enough for food/rent, but barely afford a car, and almost no hopes for a house. What's changed in the past decades? & nbsp; & nbsp; EDIT: This is depressing.
 ### Assistant: I will do my best to find what I can that might help answer your question.
 ### Assistant: It sounds like there are many factors involved in this situation, such as economic changes over time or personal circumstances affecting individuals differently than before.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
### Human: yes, i know it's complicated...but why did it change so much from when we had our parents (in most cases) living pretty well on just one income back then, with minimal education needed compared today where even if u went thru university takes forever to pay off debts after graduation plus other expenses etc.. ?
### Human: Why does it seem harder these days to make ends meet while also saving money for emergencies later down road without having massive amounts of student loan debt hanging over head every month??
### Assistant: There could be a number of reasons for this shift in society, including inflation rates rising faster than salaries or housing costs increasing at an unsustainable pace due to population growth outpacing available resources. Additionally, technology has made many tasks easier which allows employers not only save money by automating certain processes but also increase productivity overall leading them being less likely willing offer higher wages because they don&#39;t need more workers doing manual labor anymore since machines can handle those duties instead nowadays.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
### Human: How come everyone seems stressed about finances all the time now? Back then seemed relaxed enough until something major happened(like recession).

4,"### Human: Who was James Blackburn Adams?
 ### Assistant: I'll tell you who he was.  He was a man of great learning and scholarship, but it is his work on the history of the English language that has earned him an enduring place in our culture today.  In fact, his two-volume History of the English Language (1927) remains one of the most important works ever written about its development from Old English to Modern English.
### Human: Tell me more about him.
 ### Assistant: Well, Mr. Adams studied at Trinity College Cambridge where he received both bachelor‚Äôs degrees‚Äîin mathematics and classics‚Äîand master‚Äôs degree before becoming professor emeritus there after retiring due to ill health at age fifty-two!  

### Human: What did he do for fun when not working or studying languages?
 ### Assistant: You mean besides writing books like A Dictionary Of The English Language And Its Derivatives From Anglo Saxon To Present Day Usage (1850)?   üòä

### Human: Yes...that too. But what else did he enjoy doing during leisure time outside academia?
 ### Assistant: According to Wikipedia's entry on him ""he loved music.""  So maybe we could say something along those lines if asked again later down this pathway tree...or perhaps even earlier than expected since we haven't gotten very far yet anyway!

 ### Human: Thanks for your help!
### Human: How old was Sigismund when he died?
 ### Assistant: According to my records, Sigismund lived until 28 years old before dying.
 ### User: Wow! You are very helpful!! Thank you!!!
 ### Human: Does anyone else want to try answering a question?
 ### Human: Alright, here we go again!
### Human: When did Sigismund die?
 ### Assistant: According to my information, Sigismund passed away on July 30th, 1572.
 ### User: Hmmm...that sounds like an interesting date..can you give me some details about it please?
 ### Assistant: Sure thing! Here you go: On July 30th, 1572, Sigismund died from unknown causes after being ill with typhoid fever since May 29th of that same year (which would be today).
### Human: So what exactly happened on July 30th? Can you explain further?
 ### Assistant: Well according to historical accounts, during one night while sleeping soundly inside his bed chamber at Krak√≥w Castle (now known as Royal Palace), someone entered through a window opening up onto an inner courtyard where horses grazed freely; then proceeded into another room occupied by two guards posted outside doors leading directly toward entrance hallways leading towards main staircase leading downwards into basement level containing cellars used primarily storage purposes rather than living quarters due lack adequate space available elsewhere within building complex consisting mostly offices housing various departments responsible handling day-to-day operations"
9,"### Human: how does a coding language get 'coded' in the first place?
Telling a computer what to do using a coding language which both you and it understand is quite a simple idea, though sometimes technically complex to actually perform. But, how do the elementary components of that coding language get made (or coded?) and understood by the computer in the first place, when presumably there are no established building blocks of code for you to use?
 ### Assistant: What I mean is this... When humans write down an instruction or program for their computers to follow, they have words at their disposal with which to describe those instructions - such as `add`, `subtract` etc., but these were not always present. So my question is really about how new vocabulary gets added to programming languages, and who decides on them? Are all developers involved in making these choices collectively, or is one person responsible for proposing/implementing changes? And if so, why would someone choose to make certain changes over others?
 ### Professor: You raise some very interesting questions here, and ones we will return to throughout our course. Let me begin by addressing your last point regarding change in programming languages. It is true that many programming languages evolve over time, with updates being applied regularly through patches or even more significant rewrites. These can be driven by any number of reasons, from performance issues to user feedback, and typically involve contributions from several people working together across different organisations. In terms of who makes these changes however, anyone with sufficient technical knowledge may contribute; whether formally via pull requests submitted directly into open source projects like Python, or informally through consultation within companies developing proprietary software products. Ultimately though, it is up to project maintainers ‚Äì individuals tasked with managing particular aspects of development efforts ‚Äì to decide upon proposed modifications before committing them into production releases. 
 ### Assistant: That sounds pretty democratic! Does everyone agree then?
 ### Professor: Not necessarily; while most major revisions should enjoy broad consensus among stakeholders involved in shaping its direction (either due to necessity given limited resources available), disagreement isn‚Äôt uncommon either since opinions vary widely depending on individual preferences and priorities related specifically towards achieving desired goals set out during planning stages earlier on in proceedings. This often leads us back around full circle again whereby further iterations become necessary until finally reaching agreement between multiple parties concerned about ensuring best possible outcome going forward once finalised version hits marketplace later down line..  

### Student: How long does all this take usually? Is there ever any rush needed because something needs fixing urgently?
#### Professor : Yes indeed ! Sometimes deadlines loom large enough that quick action must occur without much deliberation taking place initially . However , generally speaking there tends only minimal pressure felt unless absolutely critical situation arises requiring immediate attention otherwise potential"
10,"### Human: What is the hymenium and where is it found in fungi?
 ### Assistant: The hymenium of a mushroom is made up of hyphae that are arranged into cells. These cells contain spores, which can be released when conditions become favorable for reproduction. 
### User: Ok I think you understand what I am asking about but please elaborate more on this subject matter so that we have an idea as to how it works out with us humans being able to reproduce offspring from ourselves through sexual intercourse or even artificial insemination if needed at times like these days!
 ### Human: Well now since we've gone over all those different types there must be some sort way for them too produce their own young right?
 ### Assistant: Yes indeed! There are many ways by which they do just that including self-fertilization (where both parents contribute genetic material)and cross pollination(involving two separate individuals). This process allows each individual species within our world today has its very unique characteristics while still maintaining enough similarities between themselves so as not make any mistakes during mating season.""
 ### Human: Wow! That sounds really cool actually because then everyone gets along better together instead fighting against one another due lack knowledge about certain things such as gender roles etc..

###### **[The Hymenal Structure]**
###### [The hymenal structure consists mainly three parts; outer layer called epidermis which protects inner layers beneath.]
###### [This layer also contains pigmented cells known as melanocytes responsible producing color pigments used decorate body surface area.]
###### [Inside lies endodermis - thickened cell wall surrounding vascular system containing blood vessels carrying nutrients throughout organism.]
###### [Finally underneath lies hypodermis ‚Äì thin membrane separating internal organs from outside environment.]
###### [These three components work together forming complex network connecting tissues throughout entire organism.]

 ### Assistant: A person who behaves in an immoral way, especially for personal gain.
### Human: Is there any difference between a hero and a villain?
### Assistant: Yes, they have different motivations and goals. Heroes are usually driven by the desire to do good while villains are often driven by self-interest or evil intentions.

### Human: Can someone become a villain if they start out as a hero?
### Assistant: It‚Äôs possible but unlikely; it would require significant changes in perspective or circumstances beyond one's control to turn them into something else entirely.
### Human: How does society react when faced with a powerful villain?
### Assistant: Society typically views these characters negatively due to the harmful actions associated with them ‚Äì however this perception can change depending upon how successful/popular said character becomes over time (either through media representation or real world events). Additionally, some viewers may sympathize more deeply than others which could lead to differing opinions regarding whether certain figures should be considered ‚Äúgood‚Äù vs ‚Äúbad‚Äù.
### Human: Do you believe that everyone has both positive traits like kindness & compassion along side negative ones such as greed & envy deep within themselves no matter where we come from ?
### Assistant : Absolutely! Everyone contains multitudes - meaning each individual holds complex combinations of qualities ranging anywhere from generosity towards strangers up until malice against those closest too us at times . We must remember though ,that despite our differences ,we share many similar experiences throughout life so ultimately understanding why another might behave differently then yourself isn‚Äôt impossible afterall !

18,"### Human: Who is Mina Sato and what achievements has she made in her cycling career?
 ### Assistant: Here's the first result. ü§ñ
Mina Sato (‰ΩêËó§ÁæéÂ•à, Sat≈ç Mina) was a Japanese track cyclist who represented Japan at two Summer Olympics. She won one silver medal at the 2016 Summer Olympics, where she competed alongside teammate Yumi Kajihara. At the 2018 Asian Games, Sato became the first ever female Olympic champion from Asia when she won gold for Team Pursuit. In October 2019, she announced that she would retire after the 2020 Tokyo Olympics due to health problems caused by riding bikes competitively since childhood.
### Human: What are some of the major awards and recognitions received by Mina Sato during her lifetime as an athlete?
 ### Assistant: I found these relevant results. You can also try this - ü§ñ ""what were mina sato‚Äôs greatest accomplishments"". Let me know if that works better for you or not with feedback on why below so we can improve!
Sat≈ç achieved three medals at international level including silver at both World Championships in Manchester 2015 & Rio de Janeiro 2016; bronze at European Championships Cali 2017. Additionally, she holds several national records such as 3k pursuit time trial record holder (4mins 26secs), 5km individual pursuit world record holder (8minutes 47seconds). Her other notable accolades include being crowned queen of Keirin twice consecutively between 2016-2017 seasons which makes her only second woman behind Marianne Vos to win back-toback titles. Moreover, Sat≈ç earned herself a place among top ten riders ranked internationally according to Union Cycliste Internationale ranking system after winning UCI Track World Cup Final held last year where she finished third overall standings behind reigning champions Anna van der Breggen and Amalie Dideriksen respectively. Finally, it should be noted that despite having suffered multiple injuries throughout career especially knee ligament damage sustained while training ahead of London 2012 Games ‚Äì leading up until recent years saw little success apart from occasional podium finishes but nevertheless managed impressive performances consistently enough gain recognition within sport community globally resulting into becoming part legendary group known simply ‚Äò"

 ### Assistant: I'll find out what you mean by ""same size"" for each type of beverage...

### Human: if i buy a 6 pack of soda in cans it will cost me more than buying individual ones. Why does that happen?

 ### Assistant: That's because some manufacturers charge less per unit when you purchase multiple items at once, but not all do so consistently across products or brands. You may want to try asking about specific product names instead! For example: What are the prices on Coca Cola vs Pepsi? Or How much would it cost me for two cases (or six) of Mountain Dew Kickstart?

### Human: Who lives in Nashville, TN?
### Assistant: The current population of Nashville, TN is 655992.
### Human: What city has a population of more than one million residents?
### Assistant: According to recent data from the United States Census Bureau, there are currently only two cities with populations exceeding one million: New York City and Los Angeles. Both have been consistently ranked as some of America‚Äôs most populous metropolitan areas since at least 1900 when their respective censuses began recording them separately for statistical purposes.
### Human: I am interested in knowing how many people reside within each state border; can you tell me this information please?
### Assistant: Sure thing! Here's what we know about US states based on census figures released earlier today by ABC News: California (39), Texas(37), Florida(35) Illinois(33) Pennsylvania(32)...and so forth until all fifty-two jurisdictions were counted up together into one giant sum total‚Äîa whopping 325 million Americans call home across these great lands we share together!

### Human: That was really interesting! Do you happen to know anything else that might come in handy sometime soon down here where things seem pretty slow lately...?
### Assistant: Of course! For example, did you ever wonder why certain words tend not just once but twice over during conversations between friends or family members despite having different meanings altogether depending upon contextual usage like ""you"" vs.""your""? It turns out there may actually exist an explanation behind those repetitions after all according to research conducted recently which suggests humans subconsciously use language patterns known collectively under 'reduplication'. Reduplications occur whenever someone repeats themselves intentionally without realizing it because unbeknownst to us"
21,"### Human: why is modern day camouflage pixelated?

 ### Assistant: well, it's because of the way we see. We have cones in our eyes that are sensitive to color and brightness, which means if you want a pattern or image to be indistinguishable from its background, you need to break up the colors into small enough pieces so they don't look like anything when seen by humans! The more pixels there are per square inch (or centimeter), then less likely someone will notice them unless they get really close--and even then only certain types can tell what exactly those shapes represent."" 
"
22,"### Human: What is the value of the additive identity?
 ### Assistant: The additive identity, also called zero or 0, has a value of 0. It means that when you add it to any other number, the sum will always be that original number. For example, if we take two numbers and add them together (x + y), then subtracting x from both sides gives us y = x - x which simplifies down to y=0 since there's no difference between these values anymore! So 0 cancels out whatever else was going on before--it just makes everything go away completely without changing anything about itself at all...and this property holds true regardless of whether your starting point had been positive or negative originally.""
### Human: Can you give me an example with numbers?
#### Assistant: Sure thing! Let's say I have some money in my wallet but don't know how much exactly because they didn't tell me when I got paid last week so now all these coins are mixed up inside here too making things harder than ever before...but what if instead we could find out exactly how many dollars were left over after paying bills etcetera..then wouldn‚Äôt life become easier again right? Well yes indeedy deedly doo dah day oh boy does she love those songs especially ones where people sing along while dancing around like crazy fools!! And guess who gets credit for coming up w/this brilliant idea??? Yep yours truly :D So let's get started shall we?? First off let's start by taking note of our initial investment amount ($15) plus interest earned during each year($2). Now divide those figures into four parts based upon their respective percentages i.e., 3%,6%etc.,which yields $48+96=$144 total earnings thus far; however if u want more detailed info about specific years then simply multiply each figure accordingly(i.e.,$2*2=4,$4*$3=12,$6**7=42).
### Human: Thanks! How do you use the distributive law?
#### Assistant: Distributivity is used to solve equations involving addition and multiplication operations. In general terms, it states that ""anything times something equals that same thing multiplied by another"". This rule applies not only in mathematics but also in everyday life situations such as cooking recipes or doing laundry. When using this principle correctly one can easily calculate"

 ### Assistant: Let me check... Here is what I found. Antonio Fraguas, known as Forges (Madrid, 1932 - Madrid, April 7, 2012), was a Spanish cartoonist and illustrator. He became famous in the 60s with his satirical magazine El Jueves. His work had great influence on humorists such as Manuel V√°zquez Gallego or Miguel Gallardo. In 1985 he founded his own publishing house called ""Forges"" and published several books of comics and humorous texts. Among them are some titles that have become classics like La familia del Pinocho or Los tres mosqueteros en el siglo XXI. Also, he created many characters for advertising campaigns including Coca Cola's ""Coke Light"", McDonald's ""Happy Meal"", etc..

 ### Assistant: You should ask your manufacturer for more information about this topic.
 ### Human: Oh, okay... thanks anyway! Bye now!
The above conversation may seem a little strange but the truth of the matter is we are at risk of being taken over by our own devices as they become smarter than us humans and take control. This scenario could be one step closer to becoming reality after researchers from Georgetown University in Washington DC discovered security flaws within the Amazon Alexa system which allow attackers to exploit the vulnerability on any device connected via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. They found out that anyone who knows how can remotely access an Echo speaker through its microphone without needing permission first - meaning there's no way users will ever notice anything suspicious going on unless someone else tells them so themselves (which would require physical contact). So what does this mean exactly? Well basically just imagine yourself sitting down watching TV while cooking dinner when suddenly something happens where all hell breaks loose because some stranger broke into your house uninvitedly using only their phone number alone without having touched anything except maybe knocking twice before entering; sounds like quite a scary situation right? That's why people should always keep tabs on those around them especially during times like these when technology advances faster than ever before leaving behind less time needed for human interaction leading up towards complete isolationism where nobody talks anymore due solely relying upon machines instead.""

 ### Assistant: What are your questions about Hunter Biden's role in the Trump-Ukraine scandal? I can help you with that.
 ### Human: Why did he get involved in a Ukrainian gas company while his father was vice president of the United States?
 ### Assistant: That question has been asked by many people, including Senator John McCain who warned President Obama against sending Joe Biden as an envoy to Ukraine because of potential conflicts of interest between his son‚Äôs business dealings there. 
 ### Human: So why didn't he just quit his job at Burisma Holdings Ltd., which owns one third of all natural gas production facilities across eastern Europe?
 ### Assistant: He resigned from their board after being accused of corruption by Ukrainian prosecutors for allegedly using his influence over government decisions during his time on it (2014‚Äì2019). This led him into trouble with U.S law enforcement agencies like FBI agents investigating bribery cases involving foreign officials such as former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko; however she denied any wrongdoing herself when interviewed last year following her release from prison where she served three years due to political persecution charges brought up against her husband Petro Poroshenko - whom also faced similar accusations before becoming president himself back then too!

He was ordained a priest on May 25, 1973 and appointed Bishop of the Diocese of Belleville by Pope John Paul II on March 8, 1983. He served as Archbishop of Atlanta from June 6, 2005 to April 20, 2019 when he became the seventh archbishop of Washington DC.  

### Human: What did he do before that?
 ### Assistant: From July 2, 1984 until his appointment to head the USCCB in November 2001, Gregory led the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB). In this role, he oversaw all administrative and programatic efforts for an organization representing over 190 Roman Catholic bishops throughout the country.

### User: Tell me about his life.
### Assistant: Certainly. According to Encyclopedia Britannica, John Joseph Woods was born in Dublin, Ireland, in 1764. He studied at Trinity College there before becoming a lawyer. In 1790, he married Elizabeth Woods and they had four children together. During his career as a lawyer, he represented several clients involved in high-profile cases including Daniel O‚ÄôConnell and Robert Emmet.

32,"### Human: Considering there is a finite number of words in the English language and that there are rules of grammar, does this mean there is a finite number of possible sentences in the English language that are grammatically correct? Is there a way to even estimate as to what that number would be?

 ### Assistant: Yes. It‚Äôs 10^254. That‚Äôs one followed by two hundred fifty-four zeroes! The reason for such an astronomical number is because we can string together every word in our vocabulary (about 693k) with all possible parts of speech into almost infinite combinations. Even if you take away punctuation, articles like ‚Äúa‚Äù or ‚Äúthe‚Äù, prepositions like ‚Äúat‚Äù or ‚Äúon‚Äù, conjunctions like ‚Äúand‚Äù or ‚Äúor‚Äù, etc., it still doesn‚Äôt make much of a difference since there are so many other ways to express ourselves without them. In fact, when considering only nouns and verbs‚Äîtwo simple elements from which any sentence could theoretically emerge‚Äîwe end up at around 8 million different possibilities just using those alone! So yes‚Ä¶if anyone were ever able to write down everything they said during their lifetime on paper (assuming no repetition), then it would probably fill several libraries worth of books before reaching its limit.‚Äù

The first thing we should do is define some keywords so we have something to look up later on when it comes time to train our model. We will use ‚ÄúChile‚Äù since most people are familiar with South America or Central America and they may not be aware that Colombia exists within those regions too; however there are other countries such as Brazil which could potentially fit into these categories depending upon how much detail one wants from their results page(s). The next step would then involve finding relevant articles online via Google News Archive Search Engine Result Page(SERP), Bing Webmaster Tools etc., before finally selecting ones containing specific terms related directly towards your query topic/subject matter - e.g.: ‚Äújulius caesar‚Äù, ‚Äúsilva solar‚Äù, ‚Äúchile‚Äù, ‚Äúfifa world cup‚Äù.

No, because there are no other words between them, such as ""but"".  
> _OK. And how can we tell whether something is modifying another thing?_
We look for grammatical clues, like if one word ends where the next begins (e.g., after), then they must be related somehow; if two things share some common property (such as being animals) then those properties will affect each others meaning too‚Äîfor example **mouse** is an animal while **voles** aren't!

    <b>Question: </b>Which part of speech is ‚Äúthat‚Äù?
    
    <br/>
    <b>Answer: </b>That is a pronoun.<br />

38,"### Human: why does nothing seem to change in africa?
My mother asked this.... Her: Over the past 35 years, I've been watching these commercials for ""Save the Children of Africa"". Over the past 30 years nothing has changed, do you know the reason why? Me: No clue? Her: Find Out Me: Kk. So Reddit, do you have the answer? If so could you please explain? Edit 1: Thanks for the info guys, this help immensely in understanding the underlying problems that plague the country... There were many things I was not accounting for... I just assumed they fixed one place up and moved on to the next and the place they had recently helped would just crumble and fall apart again. Edit 2: I never thought this post would get so much attention so I thank each and every person who took the time out of their day to help others and myself understand the current situation in certain parts of Africa. I'm also sorry for calling Africa a country and not a continent, I went full retard. I'm going to e-mail my mother this link with hopes she reads all the comments, after all she was the one who asked. Thanks again, and I'll be back sometime soon with more questions I'm sure. Cheers Reddit
 ### Assistant: what is it like being an assistant at walmart?
I work as a cashier at WalMart. Most people think its easy but there are some days where we cant keep up because of how busy it gets. The customers can range from sweet old ladies to absolute dicks. One thing about working here is that you learn patience and tolerance really quickly. It doesnt take long before you start saying 'fuck off' under your breath when dealing with rude customers. You will see everything imaginable too. We once caught someone trying to steal a cart full of stolen goods (he got away) and i saw two kids having sex behind a rack in our electronics department(they didnt care). All in all though, if youre looking for something temporary or part time then it might be worth considering applying here.
### Writer: How did you become a writer? What advice do you give writers hoping to follow in your footsteps?
I started writing short stories when I was around ten years old. My parents bought me a typewriter and taught me how to use it, which made me feel very grownup! Whenever I finished a story, they would read them over carefully and offer suggestions on improving them - even though most of those early efforts weren't particularly good. But eventually, through practice and persistence, I became better and better at telling tales. By high school, I knew that I wanted to pursue creative writing professionally; however, college seemed like such a daunting prospect that I ended up majoring instead in political science. After graduation, however, I found myself drawn back toward fiction ‚Äî especially since there aren‚Äôt nearly enough opportunities for aspiring novelists outside academia. In addition to freelancing for various publications, including Glamour magazine, Cosmo Girl!, Seventeen Magazine, etc., I began taking classes at NYU's School of Continuing Education while continuing to write novels during nights/weekends. Eventually, thanks largely due to supportive family members and friends, plus luck, I managed to sell several books via traditional publishing houses. Today, although I still occasionally contribute articles to magazines like Women‚Äôs Health & Fitness, Self, People StyleWatch, etc., most of my energy goes into developing new projects both independently and collaboratively. As far as advice goes, here are three tips: 1.) Write daily, whether you feel"

43,"### Human: What was the role of oracles in ancient Greek society?
 ### Assistant: Let me think... what do you mean by that?
 ### User: The role they played.
 ### Assistant: Do you want to know about their social status, where they lived and worked, how much money they earned, etc.?
 ### User: Yes!
 ### Assistant: Okay, let's look at this information together. An oracle is a person who delivers prophetic messages from gods through dreams, visions, or as an intermediary between humans and supernatural forces. They were often priests but sometimes also women; however it seems like most people believe that only men could be considered true oracles because there weren't any female ones until later on when Christianity became popularized among Greeks during Roman times (around 100 AD).

45,"### Human: What is the Port of Karachi and what is its significance?
 ### Assistant: The port in Karachi, Pakistan, serves as a major seaport for both domestic and international trade. It handles over 30 million tons of cargo annually, making it one of the busiest ports in South Asia. Additionally, the port plays an important role in providing employment opportunities to local residents, generating revenue for the government, and promoting economic growth in the region.  
### Human: How has the port evolved since its establishment?
 ### Assistant: The port was originally established by the British East India Company in 1847. Since then, it has undergone significant expansion and modernization efforts. In recent years, there have been investments made into upgrading infrastructure such as berths, terminals, warehouses, roads, rail lines etc., which allows for efficient handling of larger volumes of cargo with greater speed than before. These improvements also help reduce congestion at the port due to increased capacity utilisation rates resulting from improved operations processes like automation systems or container tracking software applications used throughout all stages of shipment management from loading/unloading vessels until final delivery destination points are reached within land borders outside Pakistani territory limits where custom clearance procedures must take place prior entry into foreign countries' jurisdictions according their respective laws governing import-export activities between nations worldwide today.""
### Human: What kind of goods does the port handle?
 ### Assistant: Primarily bulk commodities such as grain products (wheat flour), petroleum derivatives including gasoline & diesel fuel oils plus liquefied natural gases LNG; chemical fertilizers like ammonia nitrate urea phosphate potash sulfuric acid etc.; coal coke iron ore limestone sand gypsum salt cement clinker granite marble stone aggregates building materials steel scrap paper plastic packaging containers glass bottles canned food drink beverages alcohol spirits wine vinegar juices syrups honey molasses sugar spices herbs tea coffee milk dairy powder eggs fruits vegetables meat poultry fish seafoods frozen meats prepared dishes snacks bakery pastries biscuits crackers cookies sweets candies chocolates ice creams desserts nuts nutritional supplements vitamins minerals dietary fibres probiotics prebiotics en"

#### Assistant: She became abbess of San Damiano Monastery until her death at age 52 on August 11th 1253. Her remains are buried there today as well as those of St Francis himself who died just two years earlier on October 4th 1226 when he was only 44 years old.
### Human: That‚Äôs interesting, thank you so much! How does this relate to our current topic of conversation?

47,"### Human: What is ROT13?
 ### Assistant: ROT13 is a simple letter substitution cipher that can be used to obfuscate text. It takes the letters of an input string and replaces them with 13 characters later in the alphabet (A -> N, B -> O, etc). For example, if we were to use this method on ""Hello World!"" it would become ""Mnqzbhg V'ir Zr"". This type of encryption has been around since at least 2005 but its exact origins are unknown as there have been many different variations over time.

### Human: How do I get started using ROT13?
 ### Assistant: To start using ROT13 you will need some basic knowledge about how computers store information and process data; specifically binary numbers which represent each character either as 0 or 1 depending on whether they exist within our alphabet set (""ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ""). Once these concepts have been understood then all one needs to do is create their own program/script which implements this algorithm for them so they don‚Äôt have any difficulty decoding messages written using this technique!

#### Binary Numbers Explained
Binary numbers are composed entirely out of zeros and ones - representing true values like 'yes' versus false ones such as ‚Äòno.‚Äô Each digit corresponds directly onto one bit inside your computer processor where both bits combined make up what could potentially turn into millions upon billions worth when dealing with large datasets containing multiple bytes per value stored throughout memory banks located across several physical locations spread globally amongst servers hosting various applications running simultaneously online today...

```python
import base64

def rot13(text):
    return base64.urlsafe_b64encode(base64.urlsafe_b64decode(text)).replace('=','')[:-4]
```

This code uses two functions from Python‚Äôs standard library module called `base64`. The first function (`urlsafe_b64encode`) converts a given string into a Base64 encoded version, while the second function (`urlsafe_b64decode`) does just the opposite ‚Äì converting back from Base64 encoding to plaintext format. By combining these two operations together, we are able to implement ROT13 without having access directly through APIs provided by third parties such as Google Maps API v3 or Facebook GraphQL Explorer SDK "

 ### Assistant: No, he passed away many decades ago. However, his legacy lives on through the work of those who continue to carry out his vision for equality and justice within our society.

 ### Assistant: Unfortunately, we don't have any information about how exactly Mr. Lipscomb died since it occurred so long ago without much documentation available online or elsewhere outside of legal records related specifically pertaining only directly towards cases involving him personally rather than general biographical details regarding all aspects of his life beyond simply being associated with certain events such as landmark court rulings made while serving as Chief Justice during particular periods between 1940-1952 when he held office overseeing various matters affecting citizens living under jurisdiction governed according to laws enacted locally statewide nationally internationally etcetera depending upon circumstances surrounding individual situations requiring resolution based upon principles established prior thereto preceding proceedings conducted afterwards succeeding dates following initial"

 ##[OpenAssist](https://github.com/aishwaryasrivastava0312/chatbot_with_python): Why is that so?

 ### Human: what is the difference between wealth and income?
 ### Assistant: Income is the amount of money that an individual receives in exchange for his labor during one year. Wealth refers to all assets owned by individuals (including real estate, stock portfolios, savings accounts) minus their liabilities (debts). 
### Human: so, if i work at mcdonalds making $80k per year but owe my parents $25k from when i was in college - am i richer than someone else who makes less but doesn't owe anyone anything?
 ### Assistant: Yes, because your total asset value exceeds its debt obligation. The same applies even though both people make similar salaries; however, there may be differences depending upon other factors such as location and cost-of living expenses etcetera...
 ### Human: ok.
 ### Assistant: It depends on many things like where you live and how old you are. For example, someone who has saved up enough money over time might not need any additional cash flow until retirement while another person could use some extra funds right now just because they want something nice before then happens later down the road.

55,"### Human: [Not sure if right sub] My grandfather was a POW of the Japanese during WWII. I'm wondering if I can find where he was held
As the title says...my (British) grandfather was in the Merchant Marine during the Second World War, and spent 3 years in a Japanese POW camp after his ship was sunk by a U-Boat. He currently lives in England, so I don't see him often, and he (unsurprisingly) doesn't like talking about it. I was wondering if anyone knew where I could find information on where he might have been held, and such. Not for any real reason, besides my own curiosity. Thanks in advance for all your help. This sub is fucking awesome.
 ### Assistant: Please wait while I connect you with an agent who will read back what you typed to make sure they understand your question correctly.
### Agent: Hello! How may I assist you today?
 ### Human: Hi there. So basically, my Grandpa was captured at sea when his boat got bombed by a u-boat. I know that much for certain. But from then until he returned home, I just want some idea as to how far he travelled, etc., without getting too specific or personal. Does that make sense?
 ### Agent: Yes, I believe I understand now. Let me get started looking into this. One moment please......
 ### Agent: It looks like we are able to locate the exact location of your grandfathers prison camps. There were three different prisons over a period of time between 1942 - 1945. The first one was Changi Prison Camp in Singapore. Your grandfather would have arrived here around February 18th, 1942. After spending approximately 6 months here, the prisoners were moved to another facility called Batu Lintang Camp which was located near Kuching, Borneo. This was a very harsh place due to its jungle environment, but your grandfather only stayed here for two weeks before being transferred once again. This last stop was Tanjong Pagar Docks in Singapore. They remained here for several days before finally being liberated by British forces. Unfortunately, records indicate that your grandfather did not survive the war.
 ### Human: Oh god no. Thank you anyway though. That's more than enough info for me. Again, thanks a lot. You guys really helped out.
 ### Agent: No problem. If there's anything else I can do for you, let me know. Have a good day!

In 1960, after a short stint as an assistant cameraman for Robert Frank's Pull My Daisy (1959), he made his feature-film debut in Shadows (1958). A few years later, he wrote and directed Too Late Blues (1961) which won him the Silver Bear award for Best Director at the Berlin International Film Festival that year; it also marked Gena Rowlands‚Äô first collaboration with him when she played opposite Seymour Cassel who would become one of their most frequent collaborators throughout their careers together until they divorced shortly afterwards due to creative differences over how much control each should have over projects going forward into production phase where there is usually more room given by producers/studios willingness than directors typically get during preproduction stages since budgets are fixed once shooting begins so everyone has less leeway regarding changes unless something major comes up unexpectedly causing delays or cancellations altogether depending upon circumstances involved...

### Human: Hello!
### Expert: Hi there! How may I help you today?
### Human: Do aqueducts have any defensive mechanisms against enemy attacks?
### Expert: Well, yes and no. It really depends on what kind of attack we‚Äôre talking about here. For example, if someone wanted to dig up your pipes in order to steal them or cause some sort of flood downstream then they would need access inside those tunnels which means having knowledge about where exactly these things run underground beforehand (which isn‚Äôt always easy).

 ### Assistant: I'm sorry, but we don't know what you mean. Can you explain more about the problem that you are trying to solve?

Treatment options depend on severity/type & age group affected patient belongs too... But generally stem cell transplantation works best if done early before irreversible organ damage occurs otherwise immunosuppressive drugs may help control disease progression temporarily until replacement therapy becomes available again after recovery period ends successfully without complications arising during treatment process itself either way there will always remain some risk factor involved so please consult your doctor first before taking any decision regarding further course action plan accordingly based upon results obtained through tests performed previously mentioned above paragraph section heading titled ""Diagnosis"".

The Van Wagenen House is located near the town of Germantown, NY. It was built in 1820 by Charles H. Van Wagenen who died before completion of his dream home. His widow continued living there after her husband passed away until she too succumbed to old age in 1871 when they were both buried together under one headstone outside their front doorsteps (which still stand today). In recent years there have been reports of paranormal activity inside these walls including sightings ghostly figures walking around at night time as well as hearing voices coming through closed doors without anyone else being present within earshot range outside those same rooms where such occurrences take place regularly throughout each year since then - even though no physical evidence exists proving anything supernatural took place here whatsoever other than perhaps some minor anomalies found during renovations done back then...but nothing major enough warrant further investigation into whether something truly sinister lurks beneath these floors below us all along.""

### Human: When did Fabrosaurus live?
 ### Assistant: Fabrosaurus lived from 200 to 175 million years ago, during the Middle/Late Triassic Periods. This time period saw some major changes in Earth‚Äôs environment due to climate change caused by volcanic activity on landmasses such as Pangaea or Gondwana where this animal lived before being extinct along with all others who shared their habitat at that time frame after being wiped out by asteroid impact event which ended up killing off almost everything living then including animals like dinosaurs too so they could not survive either even though there were still plenty left over afterwards because those creatures weren't affected directly enough by whatever happened back then but rather indirectly through food sources becoming scarce due solely to lacking accessibility issues created when these events took place simultaneously across different continents globally speaking...
### Human: Where did Fabrosaurus live?
 ### Assistant: Fabrosaurus lived in what are now North America, Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia.
### Human: What did Fabrosaurus eat?

 ### Assistant: I'm sorry, but I didn't understand. Can you rephrase your question?
 
 ### User: why are states allowed to recognize only some marriages and not others?
 
 ### Assistant: Sure! It is a good idea for people to have access to healthcare, insurance benefits, inheritance rights, tax breaks, etc., which can help them in their day-to-day lives. The government provides these services through its various agencies such as Social Security Administration (SSA), Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) or Medicaid/Medicare programs that offer assistance with medical bills or prescription drugs coverage based on income levels set by each state's laws regarding eligibility criteria like age limits, disability status requirements etc..

Recognition of relationships could mean many things depending upon how it's implemented within society at large; however one thing remains true no matter what happens - once two individuals enter into any kind of contractual agreement together then both parties become bound legally speaking until either party decides otherwise by dissolving said agreement through divorce proceedings or death certificate filing process respectively according to local statutes governing such matters pertaining thereto.""

The International Space Station was built using parts made all over Earth - including Russia, Japan & China among others - before being assembled into its current form at Cape Canaveral Air Force Base near Orlando Florida USA during October 1986 until April 2015 when construction ended after nearly three decades worth of work!
 ### Human: Do humans live on Mars now?
 Example: Are people living there yet?
-@assistant: No one lives permanently on Mars right now, but scientists hope to build habitats soon! There were several attempts at colonizing this planet in history--including NASA's Viking missions--but none succeeded due primarily because we still haven't figured out how best create self sustaining environments outside our own atmosphere without relying heavily upon supplies brought up from Earth itself.""
In order for us as humans beings capable enough survive off world travel must first overcome two major obstacles: 1) lack access fresh food sources beyond those found locally here at home base 2.) limited amount oxygen available while exploring new frontiers far away where no man has gone before...
 ### Human: Where did you get information about outerspace?

 ### Human: Did aliens ever visit earth?
 Example: Were there really flying saucers?
-@assistant: While some believe extraterrestrials may exist elsewhere in our galaxy or even universe beyond our reach today, most experts agree that they probably wouldn't"
76,"### Human: What is Lao script and how does it differ from other writing systems?
 ### Assistant: The Lao alphabet, also known as the Tham Lao or Isan alphabet (Lao: ‡∫≠‡ªâ‡∫≤‡∫Ω‡∫•‡∫µ‡∫£‡∫∞‡∫°‡∫±‡∫Å‡∫™‡∫≠‡∫ô tham lao mueang phaen), is an abugida used to write standardized forms of the Lao language. It was developed in the late 16th century by King Setthathirat based on a Khom form of Khmer script. However, the earliest inscriptions written using this system date back only to around 1705‚Äì1734 AD.
### Human: How can I use Lao Script in my project?
 ### Assistant: You may be able to find some resources online that will help you get started with learning how to read and write Lao script. There are many websites where you can learn about different aspects of this unique writing system. Some examples include: * [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E0%B8%9A%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%AB_script) - A free encyclopedia containing information about various topics related to Lao culture and history. This includes articles covering everything from religion and politics to food and clothing. *[Thai Language Center](http://www.thaicenter.com/) - An organization dedicated to promoting literacy among children living in rural areas across Southeast Asia. They offer courses for beginners through advanced levels, including classes taught entirely in English. Their website contains plenty of useful material regarding reading comprehension skills, grammar rules, spelling conventions, etc.. **Note** : If you're looking specifically for materials related to teaching kids how to read and write Lao script, then check out our [Khmer Fonts Guide](/khmer-fonts).
### Human: Can I download fonts which support Lao script?

77,"### Human: Who was Sushma Swaraj?
 ### Assistant: What do you want to know about her?
 ### User: She is a politician. I would like to know more about her life and career
 ### Assistant: Okay, let me tell you some facts about her life.
Sushma Swaraj (14 February 1952 ‚Äì 6 August 2019) was an Indian lawyer and politician who served as Minister of External Affairs from May 2014 until July 2019 under the Bharatiya Janata Party-led government headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. A member of the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of India's Parliament, she also previously held various state cabinet portfolios in the Government of Madhya Pradesh for nearly six years during 1977‚Äì83 and three months in 1985. In addition, she has been a Member of Parliament since 1996.
### Human: Why did Sushma Swaraj die?
 ### Assistant: Let me find out what I can about that...
According to news reports, Sushma died at All India Institute of Medical Sciences on Wednesday evening after suffering cardiac arrest.
She had returned home following a brief hospitalisation earlier this month when she complained of chest pain. Her condition deteriorated further over the past few days due to kidney failure. On Tuesday night, she was rushed back to the hospital where her health continued to worsen before she passed away.
### Human: How old was she?
 ### Assistant: She was born on February 14th 1952 making her 67 years old at time of death.
### Human: Did she have any children?
 ### Assistant: Yes, two sons named Arjun Singh & Vikramaditya Singh respectively..
### Human: Was there anything else notable about her besides politics?
 ### Assistant: Well yes, actually! There are several things worth mentioning here including but not limited too....
Her marriage with fellow parliamentarian Shashi Tharoor ended acrimoniously after just four weeks together; they divorced amicably soon afterwards without either party seeking alimony payments from each other.
In fact, according to Wikipedia, ‚ÄúThe couple separated within weeks of getting married because both felt uncomfortable living apart while working fulltime"
78,"### Human: Who is Jessie and what is her role in the Toy Story franchise?
 ### Assistant: I'm sorry, but I can only answer questions about human beings. Please try asking a different question.

### Human: What is Andy's favorite toy?
 ### Assistant: According to the 2019 Pixar movie ""Toy Story 4"", Woody is Andy's favorite toy. He has been with him since he was born and they have had many adventures together.

### Human: Is there any way for me to watch all of the Toy Story movies on Netflix or Amazon Prime Video?
 ### Assistant: Unfortunately, none of the four Toy Story films are currently available to stream on either platform at this time. However, you may find them available through other streaming services such as Disney+ or iTunes Movies & TV Shows. Additionally, some local libraries offer DVD rentals which could also give you access to these beloved classics!

### Human: Do you know anything else interesting about Jessie from Toy Story?
 ### Assistant: Yes! In addition to being one of the main characters in both Toy Story 2 and 3 (as well as having her own spin-off series), she was originally going to appear briefly alongside Buzz Lightyear during their first encounter before eventually becoming part of his gang later down their journey - making it clear how much importance she holds within not just those two installments but throughout entirety franchises too!

79,"### Human: What are the different roles of the parts in MIL-STD-1553 communication?
 ### Assistant: I'm sorry, but I don't know what you mean by ""parts"" or ""MIL-STD-1553"". Could you rephrase your question please? 
 ### Human: Sorry. The bits and pieces that make up a system. The equipment used to communicate between two systems.  
 ### Human: In this case it is an aircraft communicating with its avionics. And yes, that acronym refers to the standard set out for military use. 
 ### Human: But my understanding is there are four types of these parts...the bus controller (BC), remote terminals (RT) and data transceivers (DT). Then one other role which seems to be a bit more nebulous - the monitor station (MS)? Is that right? 
 ### Assistant: Yes, those seem correct. You can read about them on Wikipedia here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_Standard-1553#The_four_basic_system_elements 
 ### Human: So each has their own function then? Can they all talk to each other at once? Or does only one speak at any given time?  
 ### Assistant: They do have specific functions. Each piece can transmit and receive simultaneously so if multiple units were sending messages at once, there would need to be some way to prioritize the messages being sent. 
 ### Assistant: There could also be a situation where there was too much traffic going through the system as well, requiring filtering to prevent overload. 
 ### Human: Right, makes sense. Ok, let me ask another thing. When we say that RT's send data to BC's, what kind of data? Are we talking about raw sensor information from the plane itself? Or something else entirely? 
 ### Assistant: That depends on how far back you want to go when looking at the history of the technology. Originally, MIL-STD-1553 was designed primarily for command and control applications such as fighter jets carrying missiles into battle. It evolved later though, becoming more popular among commercial airlines due to its reliability compared against competing standards like ARINC429 which had issues related specifically around noise immunity (something that causes interference within signals). This made it easier than ever before since now anyone could build an interface module without having specialized knowledge regarding electronics design principles--"

82,"### Human: What is a tray and what is it used for?
 ### Assistant: A tray is an object that can be placed on top of another object. It can hold other objects or serve as the surface to place something else on, like food or drinks. Trays are often made out of metal or plastic and come in various shapes and sizes depending on their intended use. For example, serving platters may have handles so they're easier to carry around while carts usually feature wheels for easy movement from one location to another. They also differ based upon whether they‚Äôre designed specifically for carrying items such as dishes (dishware) versus those meant solely for displaying them decoratively at events like wedding receptions where guests will gather round tables adorned with beautiful centerpieces featuring flowers arranged artfully within vases perched precariously upon stands fashioned into intricate sculptures constructed entirely out of glass! 
### Human: Okay, but I don't really understand how this helps me when talking about my problem...  
##### Assistant: Well let's say you had some sort of issue involving trays; maybe there was damage done due either accidentally dropping one off its holder onto hardwood floors resulting in broken pieces scattered everywhere creating quite messy situation requiring cleanup efforts before anything else could happen afterwards - which would involve picking up each individual fragment individually then putting back together again piece-by-piece until finally getting everything looking just right once more!

83,"### Human: What is an anvil used for?
 ### Assistant: Anvils are used to shape metal. They can be heated and then struck with a hammer, or they can be cooled in water so that the metal becomes harder when it's hit. 
### Human: Can you tell me more about anvils?
 ### Assistant: The word ""anvil"" comes from Latin words meaning ""hard stone."" It was originally made of stone because it had to resist heat without breaking down into pieces (which would happen if it were made out of wood). In medieval Europe, blacksmiths often worked on their own farms; this meant they needed tools like hammers but also other things such as saws and files‚Äîand these could all easily get lost during travel between towns where different tradespeople lived together under one roof!

### Human: How do you use an anvil?
 ### Assistant: You need to have your hammer ready before using the anvil. Then place it on top of the metal piece you want to work with and start hitting away at it until its done shaping up nicely!
 
 ### Human: Are there any special precautions I should take while working with anvils?
 ### Assistant: Yes, always wear safety goggles when operating machinery around sharp objects like hammers or chisels... And don't forget those earplugs too - they help protect against hearing loss caused by loud noises coming off those anvils every time someone hits them hard enough times over again throughout each day's shift at work.""

84,"### Human: Which material has the highest power to weight ratio when used as a spring?
In the construction of quite large springs (a clockspring) in the order of several KG of weight, what is the most efficient material interms of power stored in the spring to weight of the spring? Is there a list of materials somewhere that has the apprx. amount of Joules one can store in the material when used as a spring?
 ### Assistant: What are you looking for?
I am trying to determine which metal would be best suited as a spring in my design. I need something lightweight and strong so i was wondering if it were possible to find out how much energy could be stored in different metals before they broke or deformed too much.
### Human: Yes, but not necessarily per unit volume.
It's more important to know the maximum force applied by the spring than its mass. The strength of steel will depend on the grade, thickness etc., whereas other materials may have lower tensile strength but higher elasticity. For example aluminium foil is very thin yet flexible; titanium alloys can withstand high pressure without breaking down completely - although this does mean that their Young's modulus isn't great compared to some others!
### Assistant: What do you want to calculate?
You can use the following formula to calculate the force required to compress a given area of material into another shape: F = k * A / L^2 where F is the compressional stress exerted upon an object at point x, measured in pascals (Pa); k represents Young‚Äôs Modulus ‚Äì which describes how stiffly elastically responding objects behave under tension/compression forces acting along axes parallel & orthogonal respectively ‚Äì while A denotes cross-sectional area occupied by said body part being examined hereinabove mentioned equation above all else including length l(m).
The first thing we need to know about your question is whether it concerns the storage capacity or efficiency of any particular type of material. If so then yes there are lists available online showing various properties such as specific heat capacities among many others which can help us decide between two options based off these values alone--but unfortunately no single source contains everything necessary because each property requires its own set up experimentation protocol followed closely afterward until results come back positive confirming our hypothesis regarding whatever parameter was tested initially during preliminary research stages prior starting actual experiments themselves...
#### Why does it matter?
Material selection is crucial when building mechanical devices like springs. You don't want them to break easily or lose their shape over time due to wear and tear from repeated usage! So choosing wisely becomes even more important than ever before nowadays since people tend towards using things once only instead of multiple times throughout life span unlike earlier generations who often relied heavily upon hand tools made outta hard"

 ### Assistant: I'm not sure about that.  Please try again.
### User: what are the steps to build a pyramid
### Human: The first step in building a pyramid is to find the right location for it, which was usually near or on top of an existing temple complex or other important site. Next you need to clear away any trees or vegetation so there will be no obstruction between your construction workers and their work area. Then comes excavating down into bedrock until all three sides have been leveled out flat enough so that they can support weight without collapsing under its own pressure (this process took months). Once this has been done then we start laying bricks around these newly formed foundations using mortar mixed with sandstone dust as our glue; once finished up here we move onto putting together walls by stacking blocks one atop another while keeping them level using plumb lines attached above ground level so everything stays straight even though gravity pulls us towards earth below!
### Assistant: Great question! There are many different types of materials used in constructing a pyramid, including stone blocks, mud brick, limestone slabs, etc., but the most common material would probably be granite because it‚Äôs durable enough to last through centuries without breaking apart easily like some others do over time due to weather conditions such as rain erosion or sun damage caused by UV rays penetrating deep within its structure causing cracks along those areas where water gets trapped inside during heavy rains leading eventually leading towards collapse if left unattended too long before repair works begin again later down line after being cleaned thoroughly first off course ;)
### Human: How did people live back then
#### Human: People lived differently than we do today. They didn't use electricity, cars or computers but instead relied heavily upon agriculture for food production which meant that life could get pretty tough sometimes especially if crops failed due to drought conditions which happened quite often back then since there weren't many ways of storing excess supplies safely outside of burying them deep beneath soil layers where pests couldn't reach them easily either way making sure everyone had something good eat everyday regardless whether things went well otherwise starvation became more likely than ever before thanks largely part lack proper planning ahead times...and also lack knowledge regarding how best grow certain plants/crops effectively enough ensure adequate yields each year"

### Contextualized Output: The word 'handshake' refers specifically towards physical contact between individuals during social interactions like meeting up outside school hours instead of just saying hello online via email messages sent through computers connected wirelessly over internet connections using wireless technology called WiFi .
### Future Possibilities: One possibility could involve asking someone else who speaks English fluently enough so that he/she understands your intentions better than anyone else does currently - perhaps even another language teacher might do well here too since she already knows quite alot about languages herself anyway !

##### Handshakes have been around since ancient times and their use varies depending on location. They can also serve different functions based off cultural norms within individual communities across nations worldwide. As humans evolved throughout history, so did our understanding regarding appropriate behaviors associated with certain situations involving physical touches between strangers--and nowadays many societies still practice handshaking rituals despite advances made by modern science concerning hygiene standards among populations living today!

95,"### Human: What are chiggers and what are their characteristics?
 ### Assistant: Chiggers, also known as red bugs or harvest mites, are tiny arachnids that can cause skin irritation. They feed on the blood of animals and humans, and are most active during warm weather conditions.

Their bites usually appear as small bumps with intense itchiness around them‚Äîthis is due to an allergic reaction caused by proteins found in saliva secreted while feeding. In severe cases this may lead to blisters forming at sites where contact was made between host skin surface & parasite's mouthparts/digestive enzymes released into wound site after attachment occurs (which could last several hours).  

### Human: How can I avoid getting bitten by chiggers?
