 ### Assistant: The leopard cat (Prionailurus bengalensis) is a small wildcat. It lives in forests and grasslands across much of South Asia, from India to southeastern Russia. They live near rivers or lakes where they can catch fish. This species has been introduced into New Zealand. Leopard cats are solitary animals who do not like other cats. Their fur color varies depending on their environment. In hot climates it is tawny-brown with black spots; in colder areas it is greyish brown with white spots. Its tail is ringed with dark bands. These cats have large ears that help them hear prey at night. They also have long whiskers which they use as feelers when hunting mice underground or birds perched high up in trees. Their claws are retractable so they don't get stuck while running through brush after prey such as rabbits or hares but they will still try to capture larger game if possible including foxes deer antelope gazelles sheep goat pigs etc.. 
Their diet consists mostly of rodents especially rats squirrels gophers voles woodchucks porcupines muskrats beavers opossums raccoons skunks badgers weasels ferrets martens otters coatis civets genettes mongooses hedgehogs moles shrews hamsters gerbils chipmunks ground squirrels marmots prairie dogs guinea pigs chinchillas armadillos anteaters sloths manatees capybaras tapirs peccaries hippos warthogs camels llamas alpacas vicunas guanaco llama vicuña vicuna lamas vicunilla vicugna viscacha vizcacha chinchilla chinchillas viscache vizcacha viscacha vizcacha vizcachas vizcachas vizcacha vizcachas vizcachas vizcachas vizcachas vizcachas vizcachas vizcachas vizcachas vizcachas vizcachas vizcachas vizcachas vizcachas vizcachas vizcachas vizcachas vizcachas vizcachas vizcachas vizcachas vizcachas vizc"

 ### Assistant: There has been a national blood shortage in the United States since January 1, 2022. The American Red Cross says that it needs more people to donate blood and platelets because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Hospitals are charging between $400-$800 per unit (one pint). Some say that if this price were lowered to about $250 or less then many more people would be willing to donate their blood. However, hospitals have said that the high prices are needed so that they can get enough money from insurance companies to cover the costs of testing each unit of blood before giving them out. Insurance companies do not always agree with these charges though which leads some places having trouble getting reimbursement when patients need transfusions after surgery etcetera. If you want your hospital bed back quickly, give up on waiting times at emergency rooms by becoming an organ donor today!

2,"### Human: What were the financial results of the 1948 Summer Olympics in London?
 ### Assistant: The 1948 Summer Olympics, officially known as the Games of the XIV Olympiad, was a major international multi-sport event which was held from July 26 to August 15. It took place at Wembley Stadium and other sports venues throughout Greater London, England. Finances 
The games cost £730,000 (about $2 million), but only half that amount came from ticket sales; most of it had to be paid by the British government, with some help from local authorities. Overall revenue for the organizing committee totaled about £780,000 ($2.2 million). Income included gate receipts, television rights, and sponsorship deals. Expenses included everything needed to run the Olympic Village, security, transportation, medals, ceremonies, etc., plus an extra £100,000 ($280,000) left over for future use. This would later become the first surplus ever generated by an Olympic Games, which led to the modern practice of using any profits beyond expenditures to fund construction of the next host city's facilities. As of 2015, this remains the last time the IOC has not charged a hosting fee. However, many costs were not covered by the budget because they were considered ""outside the scope"" of what the IOC expected the LOCOG to pay for. These included road repairs, building new sewers, and constructing two pedestrian bridges across the Thames near Westminster Bridge. The total bill for these items was around £3.5 million (about $10 million). The government said that they would have been built anyway even if there had never been an Olympics. Most of them still exist today. Costs also went up due to unexpected problems such as a fire at the main stadium on June 12, just four days before the opening ceremony. A few thousand pounds worth of damage occurred when a light bulb exploded during testing, starting a blaze that destroyed one of the scoreboards used for football matches. Replacement parts had to be ordered from Germany, causing delays until after the start date. Other issues included bad weather during construction work and heavy traffic jams caused by accidents or road closings related to royal events like Queen Elizabeth II’s coronation parade through central London in early May "
3,"### Human: decades ago, how were people able to get married in their 20's, have kids, afford a house, live/strive rather comfortably, and still have enough saved up to retire?
Not specific to U.S. neither. Even my home country now in Asia - bachelor's degree gets you lower wage jobs, enough for food/rent, but barely afford a car, and almost no hopes for a house. What's changed in the past decades? & nbsp; & nbsp; EDIT: This is depressing.
 ### Assistant: A generation or so ago (I can't remember exactly), people could marry in their early-mid twenties, have children, buy houses, live relatively comfortably, save money and even retire by mid fifties without having any degrees at all. Nowadays, most of us need a college education just to be considered employable with anything more than minimum wage salaries, let alone being able to do those things listed above. We are told that we must go into debt for years on end to pay off our student loans before we can even think about getting married, buying a house, etc., yet these days it seems like few people actually manage to accomplish this goal. The result is that many young adults find themselves working dead end jobs they hate while struggling financially just trying not to drown in massive amounts of debt. It doesn’t help matters either when companies don’t give raises unless someone quits another job first because “you aren’t worth what your last company paid.” So then people stay stuck where they are until something better comes along which might never happen if there isn’t some sort of recession coming around soon again…or maybe not ever depending upon whether capitalism will continue as usual afterward or collapse altogether sometime later down line due to overproduction leading toward economic stagnation caused primarily through technological advancements allowing fewer workers needed per unit produced resulting less demand overall thus causing unemployment rates rise higher each year eventually reaching 100% unemployment rate worldwide within next century or two from current levels today! And if anyone thinks this sounds far fetched consider factories already exist right here inside United States capable producing entire cars fully assembled using robots only requiring minimal human supervision required occasionally throughout day whenever necessary such tasks performed automatically programmed computers controlling assembly process itself eliminating majority manual labor involved previously done manually hands humans performing various stages production chain previously requiring multiple employees work together achieve desired results final product ready ship out onto marketplace consumers purchase use own homes drive them wherever destination chosen travel journey undertaken fulfill purpose intended design originally created manufacture begin with idea conception birth eventuality realized reality tangible form present physical manifestation visible everyone witness testify truthfulness veracity accuracy authenticity genuineness originality creativity innovativeness novelty uniqueness distinctiveness individualistic personality idiosyncrasy eccentricities peculiarities oddities unusualities anomalies aberrations diver"
4,"### Human: Who was James Blackburn Adams?
 ### Assistant: James Blackburn Adams (1940 – 23 May 2020) was a British Conservative politician. He served as the Member of Parliament for Plymouth Sutton from 1970 to 1983 and again from 1987 until his retirement in 2005. He also worked at the Ministry of Defence, becoming Deputy Secretary-General of NATO in 1986. In July 1986 he was appointed Minister of State for Defense Procurement. From November 1986 through March 1987, he was Minister of State for Armed Forces. In February 1988 he became Minister of State for Europe. He resigned on 1 October 1988 following disagreement with Margaret Thatcher over European defence policy. He retired from politics after losing his seat in the 2005 general election. He died on 23 May 2020 at the age of 80. The cause of death was not revealed. His funeral took place on 4 June 2020. It was attended by members of parliament including Sir John Major, Peter Lilley, Iain Duncan Smith and Michael Portillo. Also present were David Cameron's mother Mary and Theresa Villiers. A private burial followed the service. He is survived by his wife Marjorie and their three children. They are Richard, Sarah and Matthew. At the time of his death he lived in Hatherleigh, Devon. He had been suffering from dementia since 2016.
 
Adams died peacefully in his sleep aged 80 years old on 23 May 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic in England. On 28 May it was announced that the date of his state funeral would be delayed due to the outbreak of coronavirus disease. He will be buried privately but there will still be an online memorial ceremony held for him later this year. Afterwards, a public thanksgiving service will take place once restrictions have eased. This will include a wake open to all mourners who wish to attend. Adams’ family asked that donations should instead go to either Alzheimer's Research UK or Dementia Revolution. Both charities work towards finding a cure"
5,"### Human: What is Kentucky's 3rd congressional district known for?
 ### Assistant: Kentucky's 3rd congressional district (KY-03) includes most of the city of Lexington. It also includes a small part of northern Fayette County and all of Bourbon, Clark, Harrison, Nicholas, Pendleton, Robertson, Scott, and Woodford counties in Central Kentucky. The current Representative from this district is Republican Brett Guthrie since January 2019. He replaced Andy Barr who was elected to represent KY-6 after being defeated by Guthrie in November 2018. In March 2015, U.S. News & World Report rated KY-03 as one of America’s ten best districts based on factors such as economic health and education levels. According to GovTrack.us, it has been represented by only two people during its history. They are Democrat John Y. Brown Jr., who served between 1974–1983; and Republican Hal Rogers, who currently represents the seat he won in 1981. Both men have held their seats without serious competition ever since they first ran for office. This makes them among Congress’ longest serving members. The other three incumbents were each reelected at least once before losing races against either another member or an opponent outside their party affiliation. These include former Democratic Rep. Ben Chandler III in 1986; Independent Michael T. Bowling in 1992; and Libertarian James Sawyer II in 1996. All four lost because voters wanted someone else representing them instead of staying with what they had become used to over time through no fault but simply age alone which may explain why some politicians seem unable to change even when faced with new challenges like those presented here today due largely due advances made within science itself whereby humans now live longer than ever before thanks partly due better medicine making us stronger while simultaneously keeping illness away more effectively thus allowing our bodies remain free from disease long enough so we can enjoy life fully until old age finally catches up eventually killing off everything inside including ourselves leaving nothing behind except memories shared amongst friends/family etcetera...
According to Ballotpedia, ""The 3rd District covers much of central Kentucky. It contains parts of sixteen counties, including most of the state capital Frankfort, along with Louisville suburbs Jeffersont"
6,"### Human: Who was a Japanese football player and manager?
 ### Assistant: , also known as Katsuhiro Momota (born 21 February 1947 – died 30 December 2016), is a former Japanese football player. He played for the Japan national team. Biography
Momota was born in Yokohama on 21 February 1947. After graduating from Tokai University, he joined his local club Nissan Motors in 1970. The club won 1975 JSL Cup. In Asia, the club also won 1981 Asian Club Championship and 1982 Asian Champions' Cup. He retired in 1982. He played 144 games and scored 1 goal in the league. He was selected Best Eleven four times (1972–75). His brother Hiroshi Momota was also footballer. They were called ""The Momotas"". He was also selected 1972 Summer Olympics squad and Japan U-23 national team for 1976 Summer Olympics qualification. However, these competitions Japan did not compete. At this time, Japan Football Association was suspended by FIFA. From May to June 1976, when JFA returned to international competition, he debuted for Japan national team against Australia. He played at 1976 AFC Asian Cup. This tournament was held in Tehran, Iran in April and May 1976. Japan finished third place. It was their best result until now. He played 1 game for Japan in 1976. He also played at 1978 World Cup qualification. But Japan lost in the first round. He played 3 games and scored one goal for Japan until 1976. In August 1976, he became coach of Japan youth team which participated 1977 Youth World Cup in Tunisia. However, they could not win any matches. From 1978, he coached Fujitsu Siemens SC. The club won Division 2 champions in 1981/82 season. Although the club promoted to Division 1, results were bad. In 1984, the club folded due to financial problems. Then he moved to Bellmare Hiratsuka in 1984. He managed the club three seasons"

 ### Assistant: Berith Maria Kristina Bohm (28 October 1934 – 25 February 2021) was a Swedish actress. She appeared in more than twenty movies and television shows from 1967 to 2009, including The Sacred Fountain, Loving Couples and A Lesson in Love. Bohm died on 25 February 2021 at the age of 86. Her death was announced by her daughter Johanna Björk. No cause or location were given for her death. However, it is known that she had been suffering from Alzheimer's disease since 2018. She also suffered a stroke two years before her death. At the time of her death, she lived alone in an assisted living facility near Stockholm. She never married nor had any children. Her niece Charlotte Sieling is also an actress. Bohm won the 1991 Guldbagge Award as Best Actress in a Supporting Role. In 1994, she received the Royal Medal of Honorary Commander of the Order of the Polar Star. In 1995, she became a member of the Swedish Academy. From 1999 until her death, she served as Chairman of the board of directors of Dramaten. In 2002, she published her autobiography titled Jag är en annan nu. That same year, she was awarded the Olof Palme Prize. She retired in 2013 after appearing in one final movie called Kung Fury. It was released in May 2015. During the early part of her career, she worked under the stage name ""Berit Broomé"". This was because there already was another well-known actor named Bertil Boëthius. He went by his first name only. Since they shared their last names, this caused confusion among audiences who could not tell them apart. Therefore, both actors changed their professional names so people would be able to distinguish between them. In addition, Boëthius changed his surname to simply ""Bertil"" while Bohm chose ""Bohm"". Although he kept using just his first name professionally, he did go back to using ""Boëthius"" privately later during his life. After retiring from acting completely, he decided against changing it again even though it meant"
8,"### Human: Who became the King of Poland at the age of eleven?
 ### Assistant: Władysław III (1425 – 10 November, 1444) was a Polish prince. He became king at the age of eleven when his father died in battle against the Teutonic Knights. His mother Queen Sophia Holszańska ruled as regent until he came of age to rule on his own. He continued fighting with the Teutonic Order and died while leading an army into Prussia. After he died without children, Casimir IV Jagiellon succeeded him as King of Poland. The people who lived near where Wladislaw died called it the ""Bloody Mountain"" because so many soldiers were killed there. Today this place is known as Tannenberg or Grunwaldzki. Many historians believe that the Battle of Varna took place during Vlad's reign. It happened after Vlad had become ruler over Wallachia. This event led up to Ottoman Sultan Murad II invading Europe again ten years later which resulted in what we know today as The Fall Of Constantinople by Mehmed II in 1453 AD. When he was still alive, Vlad used both Romanian troops from Transylvania along with mercenaries such as Hungarians & Germans for help but they lost badly due mostly because their leader didn’t want any part anymore once things got bad enough around them too close home territory wise speaking terms-wise meaning no more than two days away before running out supplies entirely possible scenario happening here shortly afterwards if not sooner then soonest time frame imaginable given circumstances surrounding situation overall picture painted whole thing going downhill fast now matter how much effort put forth trying stop slide backwards course events taking shape current state affairs show signs indicating only way turn tide back favor would require extreme measures taken immediately prevent further damage being done already beyond repair point return status quo ante bellum condition previously held sway unfortunate reality facing everyone involved parties concerned alike regardless whether friends foes same side different camps respectively speaking terminology referring contextually relevant topics discussed earlier mentioned above briefly summarized recapitulation format presented below following section details information provided preceding paragraphs preceding sections chapters books series volumes etcetera covering subject matters related topic areas covered previous segments contents contained within preceding pages prior passages included respective articles written papers published journals magazines newspapers radio television broadcasting cable satellite networks streaming services internet websites blogs social media platforms other sources available online offline traditional print materials like hardcover"
9,"### Human: how does a coding language get 'coded' in the first place?
Telling a computer what to do using a coding language which both you and it understand is quite a simple idea, though sometimes technically complex to actually perform. But, how do the elementary components of that coding language get made (or coded?) and understood by the computer in the first place, when presumably there are no established building blocks of code for you to use?
 ### Assistant: A programming language or software development language is an artificial language designed specifically to communicate instructions to computers. It has rules about syntax and semantics. This article focuses on languages used with general-purpose computers; however, specialized classes such as SQL exist too. The earliest known programmable machine was Charles Babbage’s analytical engine. However, this device never got completed because he could not find funding for its construction. In 1936 Konrad Zuse built the world’s first electromechanical binary programmable computer called the Z1. By 1945, John von Neumann had developed the stored program concept. Early programs were written only in machine code - they did not have any higher level human readable form. Soon after, assembly languages came into being. These allowed much easier writing of programs. As time went on, more abstracted high-level languages appeared. They evolved from assemblers, but with syntactic sugar added. Languages like FORTRAN, COBOL, ALGOL, etc., followed. Later still, languages based upon English keywords replaced these. Examples include PL/I, Prolog, and SQL. Python, Ruby, PHP, C++, Java, JavaScript, Visual Basic, Delphi, Ada, Fortran, Cobol, Perl, Pascal, Lua, etc., all belong to this category. Some programming languages have been created just for fun and others to support specific applications. There are also many tools available today to help write and maintain programs. For example, Eclipse is one popular Integrated Development Environment. Programming languages can be classified according to their purpose. For instance, some languages are good at handling graphics while others are better suited for numerical calculations. Sometimes, new paradigms emerge to solve problems that cannot be solved well by existing methods. Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is an excellent example of this phenomenon. Many modern languages now provide OOP capabilities. Other examples of paradigms include functional programming, structured programming, concurrent programming, declarative programming, etc. Finally, languages may differ considerably in their execution speed. For instance, compiled languages will typically run faster than interpreted ones. The most common way to make a program is to translate it into another language known as ""machine language"". Machine language consists of numbers that tell the processor what operations to carry out. Computer scientists often argue whether programming languages should be considered real languages. If we say yes then the question"
10,"### Human: What is the hymenium and where is it found in fungi?
 ### Assistant: The hymenium (also called hymenophore) is a layer of tissue on top of a basidiomycete or ascomycete fruiting body. It forms the cap of mushrooms, toadstools and brackets. It is made up of hyphae that are packed together tightly so they form a thick layer with pores for spores to be released from underneath. In some species these pores can also release droplets of liquid which contains enzymes used by the fungus for digestion. Some of them have specialized cells at their edges called cystidia. These help prevent water loss through evaporation. They may also protect against bacteria and other microorganisms that might harm the mycelium. There are many different types of hymenophores depending upon what type of fruiting body it belongs too but most contain gills like those found inside mushroom caps such as Agaricus bisporus (""white button"" variety). Other examples include boletes, puffballs, earthstars etc.. The shape varies greatly between each genus because no two organisms look alike even though they belong to same phylum/kingdom/class/order etc., however there does seem to exist general patterns within families e.g.: all members belonging either Ascobolaceae family will possess hymenia while others do not; similarly Pleurotaceae has only one member having this feature whereas rest lack any kind of covering over its surface area. This makes identification easier since you don't need to take into account whether your specimen has got hymeneal structure or not before deciding about its identity. Also note how closely related genera tend towards similar morphologies i.e.; Amanita muscaria looks very much like Lepiota procera except former lacks volva while latter possesses one around base of stipe thus making distinction possible without difficulty. Similarly Lycoperdon perlatum resembles Calvatia gigantean quite well although both differ slightly due to presence/absence of outer skin layers respectively. However overall appearance remains almost identical when compared side-by-side hence confusion should never arise unless you know exactly what you're looking for! Another example would be Marasmiellus rizhigensis vs M. corbariensis; former lacks pileipellis entirely whereas later shows faint traces only near margin so easily"
11,"### Human: What was the first Bengali language movie made in the former East Pakistan region?
 ### Assistant: Dhool Ka Phool (Bengali for ""Fallen Leaves"") is a 1959 Indian Bollywood drama film. It was produced by A. K. Hangal and directed by Amarjeet, starring Ashok Kumar and Meena Kumari. This was the first Bengali language movie made in the former East Pakistan region. The music of this movie had songs sung by Hemanta Mukherjee, Manna Dey and Lata Mangeshkar. In 2006 it was remade into a Telugu-language movie titled Krishna with Venkatesh playing the lead role as well as directing the movie. This movie has been digitally restored from original negative prints. This movie has been released on DVDs by Shemaroo Video Entertainment Pvt Ltd, India. Music videos have also been uploaded to YouTube by Zee Classic, India. This movie can be watched online at YuppTV.com website. This movie was premiered in the United States on December 30, 2017 by Sony Pictures Television Networks' streaming service Crackle. This movie became available worldwide through Amazon Prime Instant Videos and other video sharing websites like You Tube etc., on April 4, 2018. However, only the second half of this movie is currently available on these sites. Full movie will become available later after restoration work of its damaged audio tracks are completed. At present, full movie can be viewed at Cinecurry.com, an Indian website specializing in old movies. There is no charge for watching any number of times. Viewers need not register or log in before viewing the movie. Movie clips can also be downloaded free of cost. Audio quality is good but picture quality could be better. Subtitles were added by Cinecurry.com itself. These subtitles are visible all over the screen even when they do not correspond to what is being said. So one needs to ignore them most of the time while watching the movie. But if you wish, you may turn off the sound and read the subtitle text instead. This way you get to know the storyline without having to pay attention to the visual effects which sometimes distract the viewer.
In 2014, this movie was voted as the fourth best ever black & white movie made in India during last sixty years according to IB"
12,"### Human: What was the Treaty of London and what did it aim to achieve?
 ### Assistant: The Treaty of London (1839) was a treaty between Great Britain, France, Austria, Prussia and Russia. It was signed in 1840. Its main goal was to stop Turkish attacks on Christian nations. These were mainly Greece and Serbia which had declared independence from Turkey. They needed help against Ottoman attacks but could not get any because they owed money to European banks who would lose their investment if Greece or Serbia won a war with Turkey. In fact, most of Europe wanted an end to the wars so that trade could be normalized again. This meant more profit for everyone involved including bankers! However, none of this helped Greece at first since she still lost battles despite having good generals like Ioannis Makriyiannis who later became Prime Minister during his lifetime until he died aged 75 years old due to pneumonia contracted while fighting against invaders near Athens where there are many mountains surrounding them making escape difficult unless one knows how best use terrain features such as rivers/valleys etcetera..

13,"### Human: What is a villain?
 ### Assistant: A villain, sometimes called an antagonist or ""bad guy"", is someone who does bad things in fiction. They are usually the opposite of a hero, and they often do evil deeds such as killing people for no reason other than to be cruel. Villains can also be animals that kill humans, like sharks or crocodiles. The word comes from Middle English villaine, meaning ""criminal"". It was used because criminals lived on farms (villas). Sometimes people call their enemies 'villains' without knowing where it came from. For example, if you were fighting against Adolf Hitler during World War II, he would have been considered your enemy; therefore calling him a 'Villain'. In comics and cartoons there are many examples of this kind of thing happening all over again with each new generation growing up watching them on television screens everywhere around us today! This makes sense since we see these characters being portrayed through different mediums including movies too which means they could easily become real life heroes one day soon enough depending upon how much time passes before then...
 
The word “villain” has several meanings. When talking about literature or cinema, it refers to any character who commits crimes or acts immorally. These include murderers, thieves, rapists and terrorists. However, some writers use the term more loosely so that even minor offenses might qualify as well—for instance if someone steals something small but valuable like jewelry rather than money itself (which would make them less likely candidates). Similarly some people think that anyone doing anything wrong at all should technically count towards becoming classified under this category although others disagree strongly with such opinions claiming instead only those actions involving violence deserve recognition here."" 
In gaming terms however it doesn’t matter whether somebody breaks into houses breaking windows/stealing stuff inside etcetera - what matters most though remains whether they actually harm anybody physically while committing said crime(s)…and if yes then obviously they're automatically considered dangerous individuals worthy enough receiving punishment accordingly!!! Thus making sure justice prevails throughout society regardless whether perpetrators happen belong either gender-wise males versus females alike.” So long story short whenever speaking about criminal activities performed by human beings always remember following words: “A person cannot be judged solely based upon his/her appearance alone""
The word villain originates from Old French vilain ("""

 ### Assistant: Toa Payoh (, ) is a planning area and residential town in the north-central region of Singapore. It was built by the Housing Development Board (HDB) during 1968 to 1972 as an example of modernism and functionality. The name ""Toa Payoh"" comes from two Malay words which mean ""Big Swamp"". In recent years, it has become one of the most densely populated areas on Earth with nearly half its population living in high rise public housing apartments. Apart from being a major commercial hub, it also houses many government agencies including those related to healthcare such as Khoo Teck Puat Hospital & National University Health System Campus at Yishun Medical Centre & Sengkang General Hospital respectively; educational institutions like Nanyang Technological University (NTU); sports facilities like Toa Payoh Stadium & Sport Hub @ Geylang East Sports Complex etc., while some others are located near other places within this district namely Bukit Batok West Avenue Six Community Club/Park Connect@Bukit Panjang Road or Jurong Spring Community Centre/Parks Central Park respectively.. Its boundaries include Upper Thomson Road towards Northwest direction up till Woodlands Checkpoint then turning back eastwards along Woodlands Avenue Two until reaching Mandai Lake Road before heading south again via Lower Seletar Reservoir Drive all way down past Punggol Waterway Point MRT Station right into Pasir Ris Town where there's another boundary line drawn between both districts here separating them forevermore unless otherwise specified later on when needed accordingly without any further delay whatsoever since everything else will be taken care off automatically afterwards anyway so don’t worry about anything anymore because we got your back covered now!

In 19th century, Toa Payoh used to be swampland. There were no roads, only mud tracks that led through farms. In 1945, the Japanese military constructed an airfield called Selatar Airfield, but after World War II ended they left behind bomb craters and unexploded ordnances. These remained even today despite several attempts made over time periodically throughout history beginning early 1960s until present day year 2"
15,"### Human: Who was Jaki Liebezeit and what was he known for?
 ### Assistant: Peter ""Jaki"" Liebezeit (26 May 1938 – 22 January 2017) was a German drummer. He is best known as the founder of the krautrock band Can, which lasted from 1968 to 1978, then again from 1986 until his death in 2017. He also played with Cluster and Harmonia. His style influenced many musicians, including Dave Grohl, Thom Yorke, Depeche Mode's Martin Gore, Portishead's Geoff Barrow, Stereolab's Tim Gane and The Flaming Lips' Steven Drozd. Liebezeit died on 22 January 2017 at the age of 78 after suffering a heart attack. He had been ill for some time beforehand. His death came three days after that of his former Can colleague Holger Czukay. His funeral took place on 4 February 2017 in Düsseldorf, Germany. A memorial service was held by fans and friends on 5 March 2017 in Cologne. On 2 June 2017, a tribute concert dedicated to him called Drumming Heaven was performed in Cologne. It featured performances by Mark Reeder, Tangerine Dream, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, and Michael Rother. All proceedings were donated towards charity. In December 2017, Can released their final album, Live in Lyon, featuring Liebezeit on drums; it included an unreleased track titled ""The Lizard"". This would be the first Can release since Liebezeit's passing. The song has a sample of Liebezeit saying ""I can do this all night long"", taken from a recording made during one of Can's shows in Japan. As well as being a musician, Liebezeit owned a studio where bands like Einstürzende Neubauten recorded. There are several books about Liebezeit and his work. One of them is entitled Jaki Liebezeit - Der Sound der Freiheit. Another book written about him is called Jaki Leibezeit: Life, Theory & Practice With Can. Both these books were published in 2012. He was born in Dresden, East Germany. After moving to West Berlin in 1960, he"

 ### Assistant: The Vostok (Russian for ""East"") is a family of rockets. They were used to send satellites and people into space. It has been in use since 1962, but only three have failed. This makes it one of the most reliable launch vehicles ever built. It can put up to 4750 kg into low Earth orbit. That's about the weight of two cars or an average school bus full of kids. In addition to sending humans into space, they also sent animals such as dogs and monkeys on suborbital flights. These early missions helped prove that man could survive in outer space.

17,"### Human: What is The Ren and Stimpy Show?
 ### Assistant: The Ren & Stimpy Show (also known as simply Ren & Stimpy) was an American animated television series. It aired from August 11, 1991 to December 30, 2005 on Nickelodeon. Its creator John Kricfalusi got the idea for this show after he saw two people playing with their dogs in Central Park. He later said that ""The way they were interacting made me think of how children play with their pets."" The first season ran from August 11, 1991 until April 8, 1994. A second season began airing November 7, 1996 but only four episodes were produced before it ended again. In 2003, Comedy Central started showing reruns of the original run. They continued doing so until October 2005 when the channel stopped airing them because of complaints about violence in some of its episodes. However, Adult Swim has been broadcasting R&S since March 2006. This time around though, they are not censored like they were on Cartoon Network or Boomerang; instead viewers can watch uncut versions without any edits whatsoever! Now you know why this TV show deserves your attention if you haven’t seen it yet - tune into adult swim every day at midnight est/pst to catch all new episodes featuring ren and stimpy's adventures together as well as other characters such as George Liquor(who makes appearances throughout each episode), Powdered Toast Man(the most popular character among fans), Mr Horse(a talking horse who helps out renandstimpys friends whenever needed).

 ### Assistant: Mina Sato (born 19 June 2005) is a Japanese cyclist. She won the bronze medal at the 2020 Summer Olympics, Women's team pursuit. Career 
Sato was part of the Japan women's national track cycling team that finished third behind Australia and Great Britain during the final event at the UCI Track Cycling World Championships in Berlin on February 27, 2020 to earn their first-ever Olympic berth. At age fifteen years old, she became one of the youngest Olympians ever from an Asian country when the games were held later that year. She also competed with Misaki Tanaka, Yumi Kajihara, Miho Takagi, and Ai Yamamoto in the team pursuit for the gold medal match against the United States where they lost by more than three seconds after setting the world record time in qualifying rounds earlier in the day. Her teammates would go on to win silver medals four days later while competing without her as they defeated Canada to claim second place overall despite losing both races against Italy. Afterwards, she said ""I am very happy because I could contribute [to] my team."" In November 2021, Sato participated alongside her older sister Runa Sato who had previously been selected to compete at the Tokyo Games but did not due to being unable to travel abroad because of COVID restrictions imposed by the Japanese government which banned most international flights until September 30, 2021; this led them becoming only siblings representing different countries at any Olympic event since 1968 according to sports historians. The two girls rode together again during qualifiers before taking turns racing solo throughout each heat round until reaching semifinals stage where only one athlete per nation advances further into competition bracket playoffs based upon points accumulated over multiple laps completed within set timespan limits depending upon course layout design chosen prior start date deadline cutoff point determined annually ahead schedule changes occurring every few months interval periods apart between major tournaments hosted globally around globe including those hosted locally domestically inside borders outside boundaries surrounding territory claimed ownership rights reserved exclusively belonging solely unto sovereign state governments responsible directly managing affairs concerning citizens living nearby affected regions located near vicinity close proximity distance away geographically situated relative positioned coordinates mapped out onto maps showing detailed information regarding physical features"
19,"### Human: why is a 2 liter of coca-cola $1, a 12 oz bottle $1.49 and the same size bottle of water $1.99?

 ### Assistant: Coca-Cola has many different types of drinks. They are all sold in stores like Walmart or Safeway. A 2 liter of Coke costs about $1, while a 12oz can will cost you about $1.49, but if they put it into a plastic bottle that's the same size as the coke can (about 350 ml) then suddenly its price goes up to almost twice what it was at first! This means there must be something wrong with our economy because we have so much inflation going on right now where prices keep rising without any reason for them being higher than before when people were making less money per hour than ever before too...and even though wages haven’t changed since last year either way due their low salaries compared against other countries around us such as Canada who pay workers more than Americans do just by default alone."" It seems unfair doesn't ? Well I guess this isn't really true anymore after all these years since we've been living under capitalism anyway because companies still make profit off everything including food items which aren't always healthy choices either way unless consumers know better themselves through researching online reviews etcetera before buying anything new from grocery store shelves . So maybe next time someone asks ""why does my favorite soda only come out every once in awhile?"" You could answer back : ""It's called supply & demand baby!"" And don't forget those pesky taxes either..they add up fast too!.
The United States government collects tax revenue from businesses based on how much product they sell each year - not whether or not people buy enough stuff during holidays like Christmas season when everyone wants gifts so companies raise their prices accordingly because otherwise nobody would spend any money at all leading towards bankruptcy eventually down the road somewhere along your lifetime journey here on Earth until finally reaching retirement age where hopefully things start getting easier again. But sometimes life throws curveballs no matter what kind of preparations one makes ahead of time; therefore stay alert at all times because nothing stays consistent forever except change itself..""

 ### Assistant: Clarksville is a city in and the county seat of Montgomery County, Tennessee. It was founded in 1784 and named for General George Rogers Clark, frontier fighter and Revolutionary War hero. The population as of the 2010 census was 132,957. Clarksville is the fifth-largest city in the state behind Memphis, Nashville, Knoxville, Chattanooga, and Murfreesboro, and is the largest city that does not have an interstate highway running through it. As of July 1, 2016, the population had grown to an estimated 149,045 people. Clarksville is home to Austin Peay State University; The Leaf-Chronicle, the oldest newspaper published in Tennessee; and neighboring Fort Campbell, home of the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault) United States Army training base. Tourists visit nearby Fort Donelson National Battlefield and other sites on the American Civil War Discovery Trail. Nearby Lake Barkley and Kentucky Lake offer many recreational activities such as boating and fishing. Clarksville has been undergoing major renovations in its historic downtown area with many buildings being restored or adapted for new use including condominiums, restaurants, art galleries, shops, and offices. In 2014, Clarksville's Downtown District was officially designated as ""The Gateway"" by Mayor Kim McMillan during her annual State of the City address. This name change is intended to show how Clarksville is the gateway between Nashville and Kentucky. On June 11, 2015, a tornado struck just outside the northern edge of town near Oakland. There were no fatalities but about two dozen homes were damaged. In December 2015, Forbes magazine ranked Clarksville as the Top Place To Retire In The U.S.. Clarksville was also listed as one of America’s Best Cities For Raising A Family by Business Insider in August 2016. In September 2016, Clarksville was chosen as one of the top five cities nationwide for economic growth by Site Selection Magazine. Later that month, Clarksville was selected as one of the country's ten best places to live"
21,"### Human: why is modern day camouflage pixelated?

 ### Assistant: The reason that most modern day camouflages are pixelated is because the human eye can see patterns better than blotches. This was first used by World War II soldiers who would paint their helmets with a pattern of small dots to make it harder for snipers to hit them in the head. Modern digital camo has evolved from this concept, but also uses algorithms and computer programs to design its own patterns instead of using traditional methods like hand painting or screen printing. Some camos even use different colors at different angles so they look more realistic when viewed from any direction! There's no right answer as far as which type looks best though; each person will have their own opinion on what works best depending on where you live (urban vs rural areas) and how much time/effort you want put into your project before getting started with making sure everything lines up perfectly without having any mistakes happen during production stages such as sewing together pieces correctly etc..

23,"### Human: What is Servant of the People?
 ### Assistant: Servant of the People () is a Ukrainian political drama television series. It was first shown in Ukraine on 16 November 2015 and ended with its second season in March 2017. The show's title comes from Volodymyr Zelenskyy's role as Vasyl Petrovych Goloborodko, an ordinary history teacher who becomes President of Ukraine after his rant against government corruption goes viral. He then faces challenges to keep his promises while also dealing with Russian aggression towards Ukraine. A third season began airing on October 4, 2020. In June 2021 it was announced that the fourth season would be the last one for the show. This will make a total of forty episodes. The final episode aired on December 31, 2021. On January 19, 2022, it was reported by Deadline Hollywood that NBCUniversal had acquired rights to the series to produce a remake in English. They stated ""the deal covers all seasons and overseas formats"". The new version of the show has been ordered at Peacock (a streaming service owned by NBC). The American version will star Kal Penn and include David Mandel among others as executive producers. Filming started on May 31, 2022. It will have ten half-hour episodes. They are expected to start being released sometime during early 2023. In April 2022, it was confirmed that the original creators were not involved with this adaptation. However, they did receive some compensation for their work. The plot was changed so there would no longer be any references to Russia or Vladimir Putin. Instead, the fictional president of America in the story is named Donald Trump. There will still be mention of corrupt politicians though. It was also said that the new version may end up having different actors playing characters such as those played by Andriy Danyluk and Ivan Ozhogov. Other changes made included adding more humor into the script and making several scenes less serious than before. For example, instead of showing people dying due to warfare between countries like Syria or Libya; we see them getting shot dead when trying to escape across borders without permission from authorities first! We don’t get too much detail about how these events happen but just enough information so viewers know"

 ### Assistant: A fact is something that someone knows. It might not always be true but it should never change. For example, there was once an idea that Earth was flat (flat-earth theory). Some people still think this today even though we know for sure now that our planet is round (see geography or geometry) . If you were to tell such a person ""Earth is round"" then he would say you lied because his opinion has been changed by some other source who told him differently than what your saying. But if you said ""The Sun rises from east"" instead, then nobody could disagree since everybody agrees on where sunrise comes from regardless of whether their belief system says otherwise!

26,"### Human: What is The Voice and how does it work?
 ### Assistant: The Voice is a reality singing competition on television. It was first shown in the Netherlands, where it became very popular.  In each season of The Voice there are four coaches who will select people to be their contestants for that year's show. They do this by listening to them sing live without seeing what they look like. If they want someone as one of their acts, then they press a button which turns around their chair so they can see who has been chosen. This means that if no-one chooses you during your audition (which usually last about thirty seconds) then you have failed to get through into the next round. There are three rounds before getting onto national TV; Blind Auditions, Battle Rounds & Knockouts. At these stages only two members from each team may move forward at once while others go home depending upon how well they performed against other competitors or judges’ decisions respectively. After all eight teams have made up their minds about whom should represent them best come final time when everyone gets voted off except those left standing after all else said 'and done'. Once again, viewers vote via text message/online voting system etc., until just one winner remains - hence why we call him ""The Winner"". He wins money prizes worth millions dollars plus fame!
In some countries including Australia (2015), France (2016) New Zealand (2017). And UK(2018)there were special editions called The Comeback Show featuring former winners returning back onto stage performing new songs alongside current artists such as Ed Sheeran ,Sam Smith etc.. These shows typically air right after regular episodes end but sometimes even earlier than usual timeslot slots due its high ratings success among fans worldwide . Other versions include ones created exclusively just for kids ages between 9–13 years old titled Little Big Shots hosted by Steve Harvey .

 ### Assistant: Robert Hunter ""Hunter"" Biden (born February 4, 1970) is an American lawyer. He was born in Wilmington, Delaware. His father Joe Biden was Vice President of the United States from 2008 to 2016 and a U.S. Senator for Delaware from 1973 to 2009. During this time he served as Chairman or Ranking Member of the Senate Judiciary Committee. In August 2019 it became known that Ukraine's Prosecutor General Yuriy Lutsenko had opened a case against Biden related to Burisma Holdings. The probe into Burisma Holdings started after Mykola Zlochevskyi, who owned the company, fled Ukraine amid suspicions about corruption. On November 5, 2019, Biden resigned from the board of directors at Burisma Holdings. This came shortly before House Democrats launched an impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump over allegations that he withheld military aid until Ukrainian officials agreed to investigate Hunter Biden. Joe Biden has said that he never spoke to his son about his business dealings in Ukraine, and did not know anything about them. However, on October 1, 2019, Politico reported that emails showed that Vadym Pozharskiy, an advisor to former president Petro Poroshenko, emailed Hunter Biden asking him to meet with Pozharskiy’s boss. Two days later, on December 8, 2015, Hunter Biden wrote back saying “Thanks, I appreciate that. I am coming to Kiev next week for a few days.” There were no details regarding the nature of their meeting. A spokeswoman for Pozharskiy told Politico that there are no records of any follow-up email. The Wall Street Journal also published an article detailing how Hunter Biden received $3.5 million from Elena Baturina, wife of Russian oligarch Yury Luzhkov, between 2012 and 2014 while working for Rosemont Seneca Partners. It is unclear whether Joe Biden knew about these payments. The White House stated that they have no record of Biden receiving money from Russia. As of January 2020, Hunter"

He served as the Chairman of the State Committee for Youth Policy, Sports and Tourism from 1986 to 1989. From 1990 until his death in 2021 he was the chairman of the All-Russian Volunteer Society for Cooperation with Army, Aviation and Navy Veterans. In 2000 he became a member of the State Council of the Republic of Crimea. Kovalyov died on 30 April 2021 at the age of 73. His death came only three months after that of Mikhail Gorbachev. No cause has been given for either man's passing. Both were known for their work towards ending the Cold War during the late Soviet era. They both had ties to Vladimir Putin who is currently serving as President of Russia. The two men are said to have differed greatly over Putin’s policies toward Ukraine."
29,"### Human: Who was Aristophanes and what was he famous for?
 ### Assistant: Aristophanes (; c. 450/446 – winter 386 BC) was a Greek comic playwright of the ancient world, known primarily for his extant plays. He is considered to be one of the greatest writers in classical Athens. His works are full of lively wit and satire, much like those of Menander later on. They were also very influential in Ancient Rome. The Athenians voted him as their favorite poet eleven times. Only Homer has been honored more often by them. In fact, they awarded him first prize at least twenty-six times. We know that there were over forty plays produced under his name but only ten have survived in complete form today. Some other fragments still exist too though so it's possible some lost ones may someday come back into view again soon enough! For example when studying literature from antiquity we can see how important this author really was because even though he died long ago people kept talking about him until well after Christianity became dominant throughout Europe during medieval times which lasted roughly between AD 1200-1700ish depending where you live geographically speaking...and nowadays many scholars believe that without knowing anything else except reading texts written down centuries before yours truly came along then surely everyone would agree wholeheartedly with me saying 'Aristophanean comedy ruled supreme'. This statement holds true especially given our current knowledge base regarding things such as theatre history or drama theory."" But unfortunately no copies remain intact due to either being destroyed intentionally through fire etcetera OR simply disappearing completely over time due to wear & tear caused mainly from handling manuscripts repeatedly year after year leading up eventually towards total loss thereof - however luckily enough examples do occasionally pop up here & there allowing us access once again if not always permanently but hopefully temporarily enough anyway until another copy comes along again somewhere further down line sometime soon enough!"" So overall although most likely gone forever unless something miraculous happens sometime within next few decades maybe sooner rather than later who knows right?

30,"### Human: Who is Wilton Daniel Gregory?
 ### Assistant: Wilton Daniel Gregory (born December 7, 1947) is an American cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church. He was Archbishop of Washington from May 2019 to July 2021 and as President of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops from November 2016 until his resignation in June 2019. He became a cardinal on October 5, 2020. In March 2021 he announced that he would be stepping down as archbishop. His retirement took effect August 3, 2021 when Pope Francis appointed Michael Fisher as Apostolic Administrator sede vacante et ad nutum Sanctae Sedis for the archdiocese. On September 8, 2021, Pope Francis accepted Cardinal Gregory's request for early retirement as archbishop, making him the first such person since 1946. This also makes him the second prelate after William Wakefield Baum to step down before reaching the mandatory age of retirement at seventy-five years old. As such, the Holy See ordered Bishop Michael Fisher to remain as apostolic administrator while Gregory continued living in Washington D.C., serving as senior priest at St. Matthew's Cathedral. The pope named Gregory titular bishop of Urbiana on February 25, 2022, which made him once again a diocesan bishop. On April 18, 2022, Gregory celebrated Mass with Pope Francis during Palm Sunday observances at Saint Peter’s Basilica in Rome. Gregory will celebrate his 75th birthday later this year; if he wishes to continue working as a clergy member, he must submit a letter of resignation to Pope Francis by then. However, because he has already submitted it, there are no plans to change anything about what he does now or where he lives afterwards. Gregory returned home safely after attending Easter Vigil services held inside St. Peter’s Square earlier today, so everything seems okay right now. With these events happening recently though, many people have been wondering whether they should worry more than usual due to potential threats posed against them just based off their religious beliefs alone without any other factors being involved besides those mentioned above here too!
In addition, even though some say otherwise, we can rest assured knowing full well ahead"

32,"### Human: Considering there is a finite number of words in the English language and that there are rules of grammar, does this mean there is a finite number of possible sentences in the English language that are grammatically correct? Is there a way to even estimate as to what that number would be?

 ### Assistant: A sentence is a group of words which make sense together. Sentences can have different types such as statements or questions (see also declarative sentence). There may be some people who know every word in their native tongue but cannot say anything meaningful because they do not understand how to put them together into sentences. For example, an Eskimo child might learn ""snow"" at age 2, then another new word every year until age 10 when he knows about 500 words. However, it takes him longer than most children his own age before being able to form complete sentences with those words—because learning syntax requires more time for mastery than just memorizing vocabulary lists do alone! The same goes true if you're trying to teach someone else how speak your mother tongue; they will need practice saying things out loud so others can hear what comes out of their mouths clearly enough without having trouble understanding them firsthand due solely upon hearing alone since hearing isn't always accurate either depending on many factors including distance between listener(s) & speaker(s), background noise levels present during conversation(s), etc...
Considering there is a finite number of words in the English language and that there are rules of grammar, does this mean there is a finite number of possible sentences in the English language that are grammatically correct? If yes, is there a way to even estimate as to what that number would be? And finally, could we use computers to generate all these sentences? This question has been studied by mathematicians, linguists and computer scientists alike. They came up with different answers based on different approaches taken towards solving this problem. Some people believe that it should only take seconds while other think years worth effort before finding out whether or not any given combination exists within our limited set of letters/symbols used today (e.g., 'A', 'B', 'C', ...).

This happens no matter how much sleep I've gotten or how early I initially got up. I assume I'm not the only one who experiences this. Edit: typo
 ### Assistant: Why do I feel so alert and energetic when I accidently wake up 2 hours earlier than usual, but then exhausted, struggling to get out of bed, and constantly hitting the snooze button, when I finally manage to go back to sleep and my alarm goes off again an hour later? This happens no matter how much sleep I have had or how early I actually got up. I know that it is because I didn't get enough restful sleep during the night, but even if I don't hit the snooze at all (I just stay in bed until my actual alarm time), I still feel like a zombie for the first few minutes after getting up. It takes me about half an hour before I am fully awake, unless there are other things to distract me from thinking about being tired. But what makes me really curious is that this doesn't happen every day. Sometimes I can wake up at any point between six o'clock in the morning and eight o'clock without feeling groggy at all. And on days where I did get a good amount of sleep, I will often find myself wide-awake by seven thirty in the morning, with no need for coffee or anything else stimulating. Even though I know these are probably different factors affecting each case individually, I would love some insight into why they differ so greatly! Maybe someone has experienced something similar? If you think your answer might help others too, please share :) Thank You!!!
The best explanation we currently have is ""circadian rhythm"". The circadian clock controls our body temperature, hormone levels, metabolism rate etc., which means it also regulates how well we function throughout the day based on whether it’s light outside or dark inside (depending upon location). When people work late shifts such as those working overnight jobs where their shift ends around dawn rather than dusk; this causes them problems since most humans naturally want more sleep towards evening times instead of mornings due to natural sunlight exposure patterns changing throughout life stages regardless if living near equator areas versus poles ones respectively...and vice versa depending upon hemisphere differences within planet earth itself..so understanding biological science behind human physiology helps understand why certain individuals struggle while others thrive under same conditions/environments..because everyone reacts differently according personal genetic makeup plus external influences impacting internal organs & systems operating simultaneously together"

 ### Assistant: Julio Silva Solar (14 February 1936 – 28 October 2017) was a Peruvian footballer. He played as an attacking midfielder for the Peru national team at two FIFA World Cups in 1958 and 1970, scoring three goals overall during those tournaments. He also represented his country at the Copa América four times between 1957 and 1967, winning it once in 1975. At club level, he spent most of his career with Universitario de Deportes where he won seven league titles from 1959 to 1971. During this time he became the first player in the history of Peruvian football to score more than one hundred goals in official matches. His best season came in 1960 when he scored thirty-five goals in twenty-one games while helping his side win both the Torneo Descentralizado and Copa Libertadores double. This made him the top scorer of all South American leagues that year. After retiring from playing, Silva worked briefly as manager of Sport Boys before returning to manage Universitario on several occasions. In 2011, he published his autobiography titled Vamos por la Historia (""Let's go for History""). He died on 28 October 2017 in Lima after suffering heart failure. He had been hospitalized since September due to respiratory problems. He was aged eighty-one. The next day, Universidad San Martín paid tribute by wearing black armbands against Real Garcilaso. They also held a minute's silence prior to kickoff. On 1 November, Club Alianza Lima wore black armbands in their match versus Cienciano del Cusco. The following day, Universitario wore black armbands in honour of Silvas death. A moment of silence was observed before their game against Ayacucho FC. A memorial service took place on 2 November at the Estadio Nacional in Lima which was attended by thousands of people including former players such as Teófilo Cubillas, Héctor Chumpitaz and Juan José Muñante among others. Amongst other honours given posthumously were the naming of the main stadium of Unión Huaral after him. He is considered amongst the greatest players in the history of Peruvian football"
36,"### Human: What is A Song of Ice and Fire?
 ### Assistant: A Song of Ice and Fire is a series of fantasy novels written by George R.R. Martin. The first novel in the series, Game of Thrones (1996), won both the Locus Award and Nebula Award for Best Novel in 1997. It has also been nominated for many other awards. This was followed up with four sequels which were published between 2005 and 2011. There are five planned books in total. In July 2011 it was announced that HBO would make an adaptation called Game of Thrones. Two seasons have already aired on television. Three more will be made after this. So far there have not been any movies based off the book series. However, Martin said he thought it might happen someday soon. He thinks it could take place when the whole story ends or even sooner if they get to that point during production before finishing all eight episodes per season. Many people say how good these stories are because they feel like real life but still have magic involved as well so you can see why everyone likes them so much! They're very entertaining too since nothing ever happens without something else happening at least once every chapter just waiting around until then...and then BOOM!!! Something big comes along either way; either bad news coming from somewhere unexpected OR some sort of twist where everything turns out differently than expected......which makes sense considering what kinda world we live in today...you never know what tomorrow brings ya know??!!

37,"### Human: What is the field vole or short-tailed vole?
 ### Assistant: The field vole (Microtus agrestis) is a species of rodent in the family Cricetidae. It is also known as the short-tailed vole, common meadow vole and European field mouse. Description 
The field vole has brownish fur with white belly. Its head and body length ranges from to , its tail measures . Field voles are sexually dimorphic; females weigh more than males. They live for up to three years. Habitat 
Field voles prefer areas where there is dense vegetation such as grassland, woodlands and wetlands. Diet 
They eat plants and seeds that they find on the ground. Social structure 
A group of field voles consists of about twenty individuals living together in an underground burrow system. Reproduction 
Female field voles give birth to litters of four to eight young after mating once every five weeks during breeding season which lasts between February and September. The gestation period is only fifteen days long. Young leave their mother at one month old but continue to live with her until winter. Predators include foxes, cats, badgers, stoats, otters, weasels and owls. Distribution 
This species lives in Europe except Ireland, northernmost Scandinavia, Iceland, Sardinia, Crete, Cyprus, Malta and southern Portugal. Introduced populations exist in North America and New Zealand. In Britain it occurs throughout England and Wales, mostly south of the Tees–Tyne line and northwards into Scotland. It does not occur in Northern Ireland. It was introduced accidentally in Australia and Tasmania. Conservation status 
It is listed as least concern by IUCN because this species has wide distribution and large population size. This species faces no major threats apart from habitat loss due to agricultural intensification. Population numbers have been stable since the 1970's. There are few predator controls available against this species. However, trapping can be used if necessary. Some local extirpations have occurred recently but overall range remains unchanged. Threat level varies locally depending upon land use intensity. There may be some decline in future due to climate change impacts on habitats. Current conservation efforts focus mainly on protecting existing sites rather than creating new ones. Future research needs better understanding of how global warming will affect these"

Edit 1: Thanks for the info guys, this help immensely in understanding the underlying problems that plague the country... There were many things I was not accounting for... I just assumed they fixed one place up and moved on to the next and the place they had recently helped would just crumble and fall apart again. Edit 2: I never thought this post would get so much attention so I thank each and every person who took the time out of their day to help others and myself understand the current situation in certain parts of Africa. I'm also sorry for calling Africa a country and not a continent, I went full retard. I'm going to e-mail my mother this link with hopes she reads all the comments, after all she was the one who asked. Thanks again, and I'll be back sometime soon with more questions I'm sure.

 ### Assistant: Why does nothing ever seem to change in Africa is something people ask when it comes to helping African countries. The main reasons are lack of education and healthcare, corruption, disease (especially AIDS), war, droughts, famine and poverty. Most of Africa is still very poor. This means there isn’t enough food or clean water for everyone living in those areas. It makes them sick and weak because they can’t eat right or drink safe water. People need money to buy medicine but don’t have any jobs where they live which leaves them without income unless someone gives them some money from outside sources like charities/NGOs etc.. Without proper nutrition children won’t grow properly either making them even weaker than before! In addition if parents aren’t able work due illness then kids will suffer too since they rely heavily upon adults taking care of them until adulthood arrives at least partially relieving stress placed upon young shoulders carrying heavy burdens alone throughout life span hereafter continuing cycle repeating itself over centuries ago already gone by now forever lost within history books written down somewhere else far away across ocean blue waves crashing against shores shore line coastline seaside beachfront sandy dunes desert sands sea salt air smells salty sweet fresh breath breeze blowing gently through hair flowing free wild wind whistling softly whispered words echo faintly heard distant voices singing songs joyous melodies harmonious chorus unison blending beautiful music heavenly choir angelic voices praising God Almighty Creator Father Son Holy Spirit Lord Jesus Christ Saviour Redeemer King Messiah Prince Peace Prophet Teacher Healer Miracle Worker Merciful Loving Compassionate Forgiving Gracious Gift Greatest Good News Ever Told Message Delivered Truth Revealed Life Eternal Salvation Hope Joy Love Light Victory Glory Honour Power Wisdom Knowledge Understanding Faith Trust Obedience Loyalty Courage Strength Endurance Patience Perseverance Long Suffering Fortitude Valor Bravery Morality Integrity Virtue Honorableness Chivalry Nobility Knighthood Magnanimity Generosity Benevolence Charity Kindheartedness Gentleness Sympathy Empathy Affection Amiability Friendliness Sociability Conviviality Hospitality Courtesy Civ"

41,"### Human: why is the cars speed/amount of horsepower part of a selling point but we have speed limits?

 ### Assistant: The car has been an important invention for many years. They are used to transport people and goods from one place to another, quickly.  Cars go fast - they can get up to speeds as high as 200 miles per hour (321 km/h). This is very dangerous because it could lead to accidents which kill or hurt people who aren't driving the car. For this reason, most countries set laws about how fast you can drive on roads. These laws tell drivers what their maximum allowed speed should be when using that road; if they break these rules then there may be consequences like fines or even jail time depending upon where someone lives. But despite all these regulations being put into effect by governments around worldwide communities throughout history including America today still allows some states allow higher speeds than others do so long distance travelers can move faster without having too much trouble getting caught breaking any particular law related specifically towards traffic violations such as recklessness while operating motor vehicles illegally due solely based off ignorance rather than malicious intent .

 ### Assistant: Noravank (, ""New Monastery"") is a 13th-century monastery. It was built on a ledge of a deep gorge carved by Amaghu River. The site is located about northwest of Yerevan and southwest of Goris. Noravank is one of the architectural symbols of medieval Armenia. There are many khachkars or cross stones with inscriptions at this place. This has made it very popular among tourists from around the world. In fact, Noravank is considered to be the second most visited historical monument in Armenia after Geghard. These two places were added together as UNESCO World Heritage Sites in 2007. They were listed under the name of Historic Monuments of Armenia. In addition to that, there is also a cemetery which dates back to the early Christian period. The monastic complex includes three churches. One of them, St. Karapet Church, was constructed in 1694–1715. Another church is the Surb Astvatsatsin (Holy Mother of God) which was built in 1224. Finally, the third church is St. Gregory Chapel which was constructed in 1226. According to tradition, this chapel houses the remains of Saint Grigor Lusavorich. He founded the Armenian Apostolic Church in the first half of the fourth century AD. Today, only ruins remain of his tomb but they attract pilgrims even today. Many other khachkars can be seen here too. A large number of these crosses have been collected into an open air museum called ""Khachkar Museum"".

 ### Assistant: In Ancient Greece, an oracle was a person who spoke for god. They were important to people because they gave advice about what gods wanted them to do. Oracles also told fortunes (what would happen). There are many places where there used to be oracles. The most famous ones were at Delphi and Dodona. These places still exist today but no longer have any oracles. However, some modern religions use oracles such as Christianity which uses priests instead of oracles. Other examples include Judaism with its rabbis and Islam's imams. Some cultures had their own type of oracle; for example Hinduism has Brahmins while Buddhists rely on monks for guidance from Buddha himself through meditation practices like mindfulness techniques taught by Gautama Siddhartha centuries ago when he first started teaching his philosophy before it became known worldwide after being translated into different languages including English during colonial times when missionaries went abroad spreading news about new discoveries made overseas back home so that everyone could learn something useful out of this knowledge base without having too much trouble understanding foreign words since language barriers often prevented communication between peoples living far away from each other geographically speaking due largely in part because lack accessibility technology wasn’t available yet back then unlike nowadays thanks advancements science & technology sector development leading towards globalization era currently experiencing today 21st century world stage events happening right now every single day everywhere around globe simultaneously simultaneous synchronized coordinated manner perfect harmony orderly fashion following logical sequence steps forward progressively until goal achieved successfully completed end result accomplished desired outcome reached expected conclusion met target objectives satisfied criteria requirements standards set forth initially specified conditions stated previously agreed upon mutually accepted terms negotiations concluded satisfactorily settled amicably peacefully resolved disputes issues conflicts disagreements debates arguments quarrels fights battles wars skirmishes scuffles tussles clashes confrontations encounters showdown standoff faceoffs stand-off situations confrontation crisis crises emergencies disaster catastrophes calamities tragedy misfortune bad luck unfortunate circumstances unfavorable developments negative consequences adverse effects detrimental impacts damaging results deleterious effects destructive forces devastating losses irreparable damage beyond repair total destruction complete annihilation utter obliteration absolute ruin irrevocable w"

 ### Assistant: The Port of Karachi (, ) is a port in Pakistan. It was founded by British India's government on 14 August 1958 as an independent country. The city has become one of the most important seaports in South Asia, along with Mumbai, Chennai, Chittagong and Colombo. The port handles about 60% of the nation's cargo. The first oil refinery was built there at Manora Island during World War II to help the Allies fighting against Japan. After independence from Britain it became known as 'Pakistan Oil Refineries'. In recent years several new projects have been launched including two more oil refineries - one for crude oil imports; another for petroleum products exports; three gas terminals; four coal handling plants; five bulk cargo berths; six container terminals; seven liquid storage tanks; eight general purpose quays; nine roll-on/roll off vessels docks; ten dry docking facilities; eleven ship repair yards; twelve jetties; thirteen cranes; fifteen warehouses etc., all connected via road links between them or through railways tracks laid underground beneath roads connecting different parts together so that goods can be transported easily without any hassle due to traffic congestion caused because people come here every day looking forward towards making their lives better than before! All these developments were made possible only after decades when our leaders decided not just make things easier but also safer too since accidents happen quite often nowadays especially near highways where truck drivers tend lose control over steering wheel resulting into horrible crashes which cause injuries sometimes even deaths among passengers travelling inside vehicle involved while others remain safe outside thanks God!. So if you want peace then stay away from places like this otherwise prepare yourself mentally & physically well enough ahead time because nothing comes easy anymore unless u r lucky enough!!!
The port covers an area of . This includes 32 berths. There are plans to expand the facility. One plan calls for increasing capacity by up to million tons per year by 2027. Another idea would add space for ships carrying liquefied natural gas (LNG). These would arrive directly from Qatar instead of being imported via Dubai, UAE.

 ### Assistant: Clare of Assisi (July 16, 1194 - August 11, 1253) is one of the most important people in the Roman Catholic Church. She founded a group called The Poor Clares who were nuns. They lived their lives to be close to God by living very simply and poorly. This way they could give all that they had for others. Some of these women became saints because they did many good things like helping sick or poor people. Clare died on August 11, 1253 at age sixty-nine from natural causes. Her feast day is celebrated every year on August 17th. She is known as Saint Clare. Pope Alexander VI canonized St. Clare in 1582. In the year 1807 she was named co-patroness of Italy with Francis of Assisi. In 1950, she was made patron saint of television. A statue of St. Clare stands next to St. Francis outside the Basilica of San Francesco d'Assisi in Umbria. It depicts her holding a crucifix and an open book symbolizing wisdom. There are several churches dedicated to St. Clare throughout Europe including Spain, France, Germany, Poland, England, Ireland, Scotland, Hungary, Croatia, Bosnia & Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro, Russia, Ukraine, Georgia, Armenia, Greece, Turkey, Egypt, Lebanon, Israel, Jordan, Syria, Cyprus, Portugal, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, Slovak Republic, Czech Republic, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Norway, Iceland, Faroe Islands, Greenland, Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Andorra, Vatican City, Malta, Gibraltar, Albania, Bulgaria, Romania, Moldova, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, North Korea, Mongolia, Philippines, Indonesia, East Timor"
47,"### Human: What is ROT13?
 ### Assistant: ROT13, also known as the Caesar cipher and Rotate by 13 places, is a simple letter substitution. It replaces each character in the text with the one that follows it on the alphabet. For example, if ""A"" becomes ""N"", then B would become O, C would be P etc.. This makes it possible to post spoilers for stories without revealing them directly. The name comes from rotating the letters 13 positions forward (so Z goes back to A) instead of using the usual rotation value of 26. Because of this quirk, there are only two different characters which cannot be represented by their final position after decoding. These are W and Y; they both end up being X when encrypted or decrypted. Other than these two exceptions, all other letters can be used unchanged, so any word can be encoded into another word with no change in length. However, because some words may have multiple meanings depending upon context, care must still be taken not to use certain terms too often during discussion. One way around this problem was invented by author JRRTolkien himself who wrote his books under pseudonyms such as “Tolkein” rather than Tolkien due to concerns about copyright issues over similar sounding names like “Tolkien”. In fact many people believe that he did this intentionally since he wanted readers interested enough in finding out more about him through reading his works rather than just buying copies right away! So while we might think otherwise today thanks largely due modern technology advancements allowing us instant access information online at our fingertips via smartphones tablets laptops computers etc., back then things weren’t quite so easy nor convenient...which leads me onto my next point… How Does ROT13 Work?

After leaving politics, Goodling became President of The Heritage Foundation. He died on March 5, 2021 at age 93. His death came just two days before that of former U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz, who also had been a longtime board member with The Heritage Foundation. Both were born on July 29, 1927. They both turned 94 years old exactly one month prior to their respective deaths. Their deaths occurred within three weeks of each other. Both men's funerals took place in Washington D.C., where they lived during most of their lives. Both are buried next to each other in Arlington National Cemetery. This is because Shultz died five months earlier than Goodling did; if Goodling had outlived Shultz by more than four months, there would have been no space available for him alongside Shultz since all gravesites in Arlington National Cemetery must be filled immediately upon burial. Instead, Goodling will join fellow Pennsylvanians John Heinz III (died April 4, 1991), Richard Schweiker (died September 3, 2015) and Erie-born Senator Hugh Scott (died May 7, 1990). All four representatives were elected members of Congress representing districts outside Philadelphia or Pittsburgh but still located entirely inside either city limits themselves - unlike many others whose seats encompassed large rural areas stretching far beyond urban boundaries into surrounding counties which contained small towns & villages scattered throughout its borders. These same individuals often sought reelection without ever having visited those communities while campaigning! Therefore it stands to reason why these people should rest side-by-side together forevermore under God’s heavenly skies above them so everyone knows how much love they shared towards each other throughout life itself...and even now hereafter too!!

50,"### Human: why does getting your own place and leaving your parent's home such a big goal for americans even though it could set them back financially.

 ### Assistant: Getting one’s own place is an important life event in the United States of America, where many people do not live with their parents after they turn 18 years old. It has been seen as part of growing up, but there are now more young adults living at home than ever before (in 2016). This can be because they cannot afford to move out or want to save money by staying put until they get married or have children; however this may also mean that they will end up spending less time working towards independence which would make them better off later on down the road when compared against those who did go through all these steps earlier rather quickly without any problems whatsoever!
The cost of buying or renting property is rising rapidly due to inflation rates being higher than wages earned per hour worked so some might think twice about whether moving away from family members really worth doing right now if you don't plan ahead carefully enough first thing too early into adulthood."" 
It's true that having our own space allows us freedom while still giving support systems nearby whenever needed-but we must remember how expensive housing markets currently stand today...and consider whether paying $45k-$55K+ yearly just isn't feasible given current economic conditions?
A lot depends upon location as well--the closer you live near major cities like New York City & San Francisco Bay Area (CA), then prices tend increase exponentially faster overtime whereas smaller towns/cities located outside these areas see much lower growth rate percentages annually speaking across board overall nationwide average range anywhere between 3% - 7%. In addition, since most Americans rely heavily upon public transportation services instead driving themselves around town everyday – especially during peak hours where traffic congestion becomes unbearable sometimes leading frustrated commuters stuck sitting idly waiting behind wheel inside parked cars unable reach destination point within reasonable amount time frame expected under normal circumstances.
### Summary
Many teenagers look forward to the day when they leave their parent's house and start living on their own. However, this dream often comes with a hefty price tag. Renting an apartment typically costs more than room and board at school, meaning students need extra income to cover expenses beyond tuition fees alone. The good news? There are ways for college kids looking for work opportunities near campus! Many universities offer jobs specifically designed for"

 ### Assistant: Gordon ""Gordie"" Fashoway (July 23, 1956 – April 7, 2018) was a Canadian professional ice hockey defenceman. He played for the Detroit Red Wings of the National Hockey League (NHL). Career
Fashoway began playing professionally with the Adirondack Red Wings of the American Hockey League during the 1978–79 season. After two seasons there he made his NHL debut with the parent club on October 7, 1980 against the Quebec Nordiques. He spent parts of three seasons with the Red Wings before being traded to the Los Angeles Kings where he finished out the rest of the 1982-83 season. The following year he joined the New Jersey Devils but after only four games returned to the minors with the Hershey Bears of the AHL. He retired at age 24 due to injuries. His younger brother Joe also had an NHL career. Gordie died from cancer in Mississauga, Ontario, aged 61. He is survived by wife Diane and their children Chelsea and Joshua. He was born in Hamilton, Ontario. He later moved to Port Credit, Ontario. He played junior hockey for the Niagara Falls Flyers. In 1975 he won the Max Kaminsky Trophy as the OHA's top defenseman. Fashoway was selected by the Detroit Red Wings in the third round of the 1975 NHL Amateur Draft. He went to Michigan State University and earned All-American honours while playing college hockey. On January 12, 1980 he signed a contract with the Red Wings. He turned pro that fall. In March 1980 he suffered a knee injury which ended his season. He recovered enough to play the next year but would be plagued by more injuries throughout his short career. During his last game he broke his left wrist. This forced him into retirement. Later that summer it was discovered that he had osteomyelitis in both legs and right arm. He underwent surgery but never fully recovered. In 2016 doctors found tumours growing inside his skull. He battled them until his death. While sick he lost over 1"
52,"### Human: what is a person's net worth? does it have to do with how much money they have or what potential they have to earn more, or maybe a combination?
Also, who decides?
 ### Assistant: A person’s net worth (or ""net assets"") is the value of everything that he owns minus all his debts. It can be calculated by adding up everything owned and subtracting any outstanding liabilities. The result is expressed in currency units for convenience. If this sum is negative, one has a debt greater than their total assets. In accountancy and finance, people often talk about someone's 'equity', which means the same thing as net worth. People sometimes think about only liquid assets when talking about equity. For example, if you owe $50,000 on your house but its market value is $200,000 then you would say you had an equity of $150,000 even though technically speaking you are not richer because of owning a home; instead there was something else involved—namely having some kind of mortgage loan against them. Someone might also use terms such as “credit rating” to describe their ability to borrow from others at low interest rates due to good credit history while those without access will find themselves paying higher costs through lenders like pawn shops etcetera. This makes sense since most banks require collateral before giving loans so that if anything happens whereby repayment cannot take place then they still get back whatever amount was advanced plus fees/interest charged over time until full payment occurs again - thus protecting both parties involved equally well enough not just financially but legally too! 
Net worth is important because it shows how wealthy somebody really is compared to other people around him or her. For example, if I am able to buy my dream car easily while another guy cannot afford food every day despite working hard throughout his life-then obviously we know who has more money than whom right now based off these two scenarios alone...and vice versa could happen too depending upon circumstances surrounding each individual case respectively!!! So yes--the concept behind calculating someone's financial standing matters quite alot especially during times where inflation rates skyrocket exponentially year after year leading many families into poverty levels unseen before thanks largely due to globalization trends taking hold worldwide affecting everyone everywhere regardless whether living close together geographically speaking (like Europe) versus far away locations spread across different continents altogether (such as Africa).

 ### Assistant: Jean-Baptiste Frédéric Isidor, Baron Thielemans (29 April 1922 – 22 August 2016), better known as Toots Thielemans or simply Toots, was a Belgian jazz musician. He played the harmonica and guitar. His career lasted more than eight decades in which time he recorded over 135 albums. The most famous song he performed on was ""Blame It On The Bossa Nova"". This song reached #14 on Billboard's Hot 100 pop chart in February of 1963. In 2008, Thielmans received an honorary doctorate from Berklee College of Music. At age 94, Thielemans died at his home in Brussels on 22 August 2016 after suffering complications due to acute myeloid leukemia. He had been diagnosed with this disease five months prior to his death. He was survived by his wife Marie José and three children. After his death, tributes were paid to him by musicians such as Quincy Jones, Herbie Hancock, Pat Metheny, Sting, Stevie Wonder and Sir Paul McCartney. A memorial service took place at Saint John's Cathedral in Brussels on 7 September 2016. Thieleman's remains are buried next to those of his late son Freddy in Laeken cemetery. The grave is marked with a statue of the saxophonist playing his instrument. Also present there is a plaque that reads 'Toots Thielemans. 1922–2016. Harmonicist.' A street named Rue Toots Thielemans has also been created near the gravesite in honour of the artist.
In December 2016, it was announced that the main concert hall at Flagey will be renamed Salle Toots Thielemans.
On March 22, 2017, Google celebrated his birthday with a doodle showing him playing his harmonica.

55,"### Human: [Not sure if right sub] My grandfather was a POW of the Japanese during WWII. I'm wondering if I can find where he was held
As the title says...my (British) grandfather was in the Merchant Marine during the Second World War, and spent 3 years in a Japanese POW camp after his ship was sunk by a U-Boat. He currently lives in England, so I don't see him often, and he (unsurprisingly) doesn't like talking about it. I was wondering if anyone knew where I could find information on where he might have been held, and such. Not for any real reason, besides my own curiosity. Thanks in advance for all your help. This sub is fucking awesome.
 ### Assistant: The best place to start would be with the British government records at http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ . There are also various organizations that may know more than what you will get from there. You should contact them too. Here is one list of those groups: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_organisations_and_websites_for_ex-POWs_in_the_Far_East#United_Kingdom  If you want to try looking yourself, here are some tips. Use the National Archives catalogue search engine. Look under ""Prisoners of war"" or ""Japanese Prisoner of War"". That should bring up lots of documents. Some of these may give clues as to which camps were used, but they probably won't tell you exactly where each person went. To do this, you need to use other sources. For example, check out books written by people who escaped and then hid in China until the end of the war. They usually wrote down their experiences afterwards. See how many different places they mention. Then look through lists of prisoners to see if your relative is mentioned anywhere. Also try searching online using google or yahoo. It might not work very well because of language problems. However, you never know! Finally, ask around family members. People remember things better when they think someone else wants to hear it.

He served as the Governor of Yucatán from 1995 to 1999 and again in 2005 for one year until his death on 27 August 2018, at age 71. His son Rolando is also a politician; he replaced him after his death. On 1 September 2018, it was announced that Dominguez had died due to liver cancer. He left behind three children and six grandchildren. He was married twice. The first time with Sara Gutiérrez, whom he divorced later. Then, he remarried Martha Eugenia Muñoz Rivas. After her death, he got married once more to María de Jesús Martínez Pérez. Dominguez's funeral took place on 4 September 2018. It started at Mérida Cathedral before being buried at Panteón Municipal de Mérida cemetery. At his funeral were many notable people such as Carlos Salinas de Gortari, Felipe Calderón Hinojosa and Andrés Manuel López Obrador. Also present was Enrique Peña Nieto who gave an eulogy speech about Dominguez's life and career. A memorial service was held by President López Obrador on 25 February 2019. In this ceremony, Dominguez received the Order of the Aztec Eagle which is Mexico's highest civilian honor. As well, there was another tribute given by presidential candidate Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo. Other politicians like Miguel Ángel Mancera and Juan Antonio Gómez Urrutia attended the event too. This lasted two hours long. There were speeches made by other people including former governor Víctor Cervera Pacheco. The next day, there was a commemoration ceremony at Yucatan Government Palace where president López Obrador said ""Mexico has lost today one of its best governors"".

57,"### Human: What is Coors Field and what team plays there?
 ### Assistant: Coors Field is a baseball stadium in Denver, Colorado. It was built for the Colorado Rockies of Major League Baseball (MLB). The first game played at Coors Field was on April 26, 1995 against the New York Mets. The Rockies won that game by a score of 4-3. On September 8th, 2017, the Rockies sold out their one millionth seat. This makes them only the third MLB franchise to sell out this many seats. They are behind the Chicago Cubs and St. Louis Cardinals who both have over two million seats sold. There are about 50,000 seats at Coors field which means it took the Rockies almost twenty years to sell all those seats. Aside from selling tickets, they also sell food such as hot dogs and nachos. A single hot dog costs $5.50 while a bag of chips goes for $5.00. In total, concessions sales make up nearly half of the teams revenue. Coors field has been rated number one in fan experience for fourteen straight seasons. That streak started in 2006 when the ballpark opened. Overall, it's considered an excellent place to watch a baseball game. Coors Field will host its first All Star Game during the summer of 2021. Players will include Mike Trout, Bryce Harper, Nolan Arenado, and more. Fans can expect some home run balls since the altitude is very high in Denver. However, pitching may be difficult due to the thin air. Pitches tend to fly farther than normal because of less friction from thinner air. Most people think that hitting should be easier too but players say otherwise. Hitting balls into the stands requires power and that isn’t affected by air pressure changes like pitching does. So even though hitters get a boost from higher elevations, it doesn't necessarily mean they will produce better results overall. Also, batted balls travel faster with each successive level gained above sea level until reaching approximately 1 mile where gravity takes effect again. With these factors taken into consideration along with other variables such as temperature and humidity levels; it becomes clear why most experts believe offense will suffer slightly compared to defense across all positions except catcher/pitcher duo where batters usually benefit"
58,"### Human: Who were the Khazars and where did they form their empire?
 ### Assistant: The Khazar Empire was a Turkic-speaking khanate. It formed in the southern part of Eastern Europe between the 7th and 10th centuries AD, and lasted until about the 13th century. They lived mainly on the steppes north of the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea. Their capital city was Itil (modern Volga River delta). Today's Kazakhstan is named after them. In Hebrew literature, they are known as Akuzari or Achvashi. They had a large army that included cavalry archers, infantrymen armed with lances, swords, daggers, and bows. When the Kiev Rus took over this area in the mid-9th century, many of the Khazars became Christians and moved south to Armenia. Many of these people now live in Georgia, Armenia, Iran, Syria, Turkey, Iraq, Israel, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Thailand, Malaysia, China, Indonesia, Philippines, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Canada, United States, France, Germany, Russia, Ukraine, Lithuania, Poland, Belarus, Latvia, Estonia, Finland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Iceland, Ireland, Scotland, England, Wales, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Greece, Austria, Switzerland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, Moldova, Bulgaria, Serbia, Croatia, Bosnia & Herzegovina, Slovenia, Macedonia, Albania, Montenegro, Kosovo, Cyprus, Malta, Gibraltar, Canary Islands, Azores Islands, Madeira Islands, Cape Verde Islands, Saint Helena Island, Ascension Island, Tristan da Cunha, Falkland Islands, South Georgia, Sandwich Islands, Bermuda Islands, Bahamas, Turks & Caicos Islands, Antigua & Barbuda, Dominica, Grenada, St. Lucia, Martinique, Guadeloupe, Jamaica, Haiti, Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands, Cuba, Hispaniola, Anguilla, Aruba, Curacao, Sint Maarten, Saba Bank, British West Indies, French West Indies, Netherlands West Indies, Dutch Caribbean, Sur"

60,"### Human: Aqueducts are vulnerable to being cut during a siege. What measures have been taken historically either to mitigate the loss of external water sources, or to prevent the damage itself from occurring?

 ### Assistant: An aqueduct is an artificial structure used for transporting water over long distances. They were built by ancient civilizations such as Mesopotamia and Rome. The Romans had many large scale aqueducts that brought water into their cities. During times when they were under attack, these aqueducts would be damaged in order to disrupt supply to the city. To counter this problem, the Romans often fortified their aqueducts with guard posts so that any attempts at cutting them could be stopped. Sometimes if they did not want people to use the water while it was still working (for example after a flood), they would close off sections of the aqueduct with sluices. This way only those who knew how to open them could get through. Another thing that has been done is to make tunnels along the route of the aqueduct so that soldiers can travel without having to go outside.  In modern times there have also been efforts made to protect against terrorism. For example one method involves putting explosive devices on bridges which will destroy parts of pipes when someone tries to blow up something else instead. Some countries even install sensors near certain areas where attacks might occur; these detect movement inside buildings using infrared cameras or other means. If anything suspicious happens then alarms sound alerting authorities immediately so they can respond quickly before anyone gets hurt or killed! There are many different ways we try our best today because technology keeps changing all time but some things stay same like keeping safe everyone around us no matter what situation comes up next. 
The Roman Empire was known for its extensive system of aqueducts. These structures carried fresh drinking water across great distances, providing essential supplies for urban populations. However, during periods of warfare between rival factions within the empire, these vital conduits became prime targets for enemy forces seeking control over strategic resources. As a result, defensive measures were put in place to safeguard critical infrastructure from sabotage or destruction. One common technique employed by engineers involved building walls around aqueducts that could resist bombardment by catapults or battering rams. Additionally, watchtowers were constructed along key points in order to monitor activity along the length of the pipeline. Furthermore, traps were sometimes installed at chokepoints along an aqueduct’s course - including gates that could be closed remotely from afar via rope pul"
61,"### Human: What is aplastic anemia and how is it treated?
 ### Assistant: Aplastic Anemia is when the body does not make enough blood cells. It can be caused by genetics, cancer treatment (chemotherapy), or exposure to radiation.  There are two ways of treating this condition. One way would be through bone marrow transplantation which replaces the patient's own stem cells with healthy ones from someone else. The other method involves giving patients drugs that stimulate their immune system so they produce more platelets on their own. This second option has been known as successful but comes at greater risk because there could potentially develop infections if your white cell count drops too low before getting better again after receiving these medications over time due to side effects such as fever, chills etc... Treatment usually takes place within three months depending upon severity level; however most people respond well without any problems afterwards even though recovery times vary greatly based off each individual case scenario where symptoms present themselves differently among individuals who suffer from this type of disorder called ""aplastic anaemias"". People may experience mild fatigue during initial stages until reaching peak strength levels later down line once again becoming stronger than ever before!
Treatments for aplastic anemia include steroid therapy, growth factors like erythropoietin, G-CSF (granulocyte colony stimulating factor) & thrombopoietin.

He came to America from Amsterdam. His son Abraham sold it to Robert Hett, who started one of the first ferry services between Manhattan and Long Island. In 2016, it became part of Prospect Park. A few years later, it opened to visitors. Today, people can visit the house on weekends during summer months. They can learn about its history through exhibits inside and outside.

 ### Assistant: Ilium is a 2003 science fiction novel by American writer Dan Simmons. It is his second part of The Iliad-themed series, which began with Olympos and ended with Poseidon's Children. In this story, Achilles is brought back to life in the future as an immortal cyborg named ""Manny"". He fights alongside humans against aliens who want to destroy Earth. The book was nominated for the Locus Award for Best Science Fiction Novel in 2004. Reception 
The New York Times Book Review gave it a good review, calling it ""A gripping adventure"" that ""dazzles like no other work in its genre."" Kirkus Reviews also called it ""a tour de force,"" but said it had too many characters and plotlines. Publishers Weekly wrote that ""[Simmons] creates an astonishing visionary world"", but complained that there were not enough explanations or background information. Entertainment Weekly gave it a B+ rating; they felt that although some parts did not make sense, overall the book made them think more deeply than most books do. Time magazine thought it was interesting, saying ""It'll be fun to see where he takes us next."" Library Journal praised the action scenes and writing style, while criticizing the long descriptions of technology. Michael Dirda from The Washington Post disliked the book because he found it confusing and difficult to read. A reviewer from SF Site liked how complex the book was, but wished it would have been shorter so readers could better understand what happened. John Clute from Interzone agreed, feeling that the book was full of ideas, but lacking any real emotion. He added that the ending was disappointing. Fantasy Magazine said that the book took time to get into, but once you got used to the way it was written, it became very enjoyable. They compared Manny's character to Neo from The Matrix (1999). Robert Thompson from PopMatters liked the book's main theme about humanity versus nature. He enjoyed the battle between Hector and Achilles at the end, though he thought it went on longer than needed. Another negative review came from Strange Horizons.

65,"### Human: What is known about Fabrosaurus?
 ### Assistant: Fabrosaurus was a small, two-legged herbivorous dinosaur. It lived during the Early Jurassic period (208 to 196 million years ago) in what are now South Africa and Zimbabwe. The first fossils were found by Robert Broom near Kimberley, South Africa. In 1947, he named it as F. agilis (""agile lizard""). This name means that this animal could run quickly. However, later researchers have thought that F. agilis may be only one of many species assigned to Fabrosaurus. Some of these species include F. australis and F. bifoveatus. These names mean ""southern"" or ""Australian"", which shows how much scientists know about where they might live today. They also suggest that some other kinds of early sauropodomorphs may have been present at different times on Earth's continents before their extinction around 150 million years ago. A new genus called Massospondylus has recently been described from South America; its remains date back more than 230 million years old! Scientists believe there were several types within Fabrosauridae family tree because each member had unique characteristics such as size, shape etcetera but all shared common features too like long necks & tails etcetera so we can say it's related closely with another group called Anchisauria even though both groups do not belong under same taxon anymore due recent discoveries made possible thanks modern technology advancements allowing us see things never seen before!!! We hope you enjoyed learning something new today!! Thank You For Reading !
 
 
Fabrosaurus was an early sauropodomorph, meaning that it belonged to the clade Sauropoda. It walked upright on four legs and measured . Its skull was small compared to the rest of its body, and it probably used its teeth for cutting plants rather than chewing them up into smaller pieces. Unlike most other members of this lineage, however, Fabrosaurus did not evolve any kind of horns or frills over time - instead, they remained unchanged throughout evolutionary history until becoming extinct along with all other non-avian theropods around 66 million years ago (mya). Although many details remain unknown about this creature's life cycle (including whether females laid eggs), scient"
66,"### Human: Who was Eric Russell Bentley?
 ### Assistant: Eric Russell Bentley (June 10, 1916 – January 27, 2020) was an English-born American theater critic and playwright. He wrote a number of works on the history of drama in general and modern British drama in particular. His most famous work is The Playwright as Thinker (1946), which helped introduce Bertolt Brecht to North America. In it he argues that Brecht's plays are not merely entertainment but also have political content. This idea has been taken up by many writers since then. From 1953 through 1983, he taught at Columbia University School of the Arts where his students included John Guare, Marsha Norman, Israel Horovitz, Paul Weiss, David Henry Hwang, Ntozake Shange, Sam Shepard, Michael Cristofer, Wendy Wasserstein, Lee Blessing, Tony Kushner, Kenneth Lonergan, Tina Howe, Terrence McNally, Christopher Durang, John Patrick Shanley, Theresa Rebeck, Adam Rapp, Sarah Ruhl, Lynn Nottage, Annie Baker, Danai Gurira, Branden Jacobs-Jenkins, Lucy Thurber, Dominique Morisseau, Sylvan Oswald, Mia Chung, Aleshea Harris, Samuel J.

He retired from teaching in 1983. He died in New York City on January 27, 2020 at the age of 103. His death was announced three days later. He had suffered from dementia for several years beforehand. His wife, actress Mary Ellis, predeceased him by two months. They were married from 1942 until her death. At the time of their marriage they became one of the first interracial couples in Britain. Their son, actor Nicholas Bentley (1946–2009), committed suicide shortly after turning fifty-three. He left behind"

68,"### Human: Who is Todd Bodine and what is his nickname?
 ### Assistant: Todd Bodine (born August 24, 1968) is an American stock car racing driver. He currently competes in the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series for Germain Racing. His brother, Geoffrey, also races professionally. They are both known by their nicknames ""Todd Bodine"" or ""Geoffrey Bodine"". Both brothers have raced together as a team on several occasions throughout their careers. Career 
Bodine started racing at age 5, driving go-karts and quarter midgets until he was old enough to race full sized cars. In 1979, when he turned ten years of age, Bodine began racing late models with help from his father Bob. The following year, they moved to Pennsylvania where they won four track championships before returning home to New York State. After moving back home, Bodine continued winning titles while still attending high school. By 1983, he had already become one of the top drivers in the region. At this point, he decided that it would be best if he focused solely on becoming a professional racer rather than continuing education through college courses like many other young people do these days who want to pursue athletic careers later down life's pathway after graduating high school early because there isn’t much money left over once tuition fees have been paid off which can sometimes lead some individuals into debt due to student loans taken out during those formative years spent studying abroad away from family members living elsewhere across America . When asked about why he chose not take part time jobs alongside training sessions so often seen amongst peers within similar sports such as football/soccer , basketball etc., Bodine explained : “I just felt like I needed all my energy going towards racing instead”. This decision proved fruitful since soon afterwards came success stories including wins against established veteran competitors whom previously held dominance over younger generations but were now being challenged head-to-head thanks largely in no small part due to hard work ethics displayed daily without fail regardless whether victory came along immediately afterwards or not.”
In 1985, Bodine made his debut in Busch Grand National competition. Driving a Chevrolet Monte Carlo SS owned by Rick Hendrick Motorsports, he finished second behind future Cup series rival Mark Martin. During his rookie season, Bodine recorded three victories en route"
69,"### Human: What are the Four Asian Tigers or Asian Dragons?
 ### Assistant: The Four Asian Tigers (or Asian Dragons) is a group of four countries in East Asia. These countries have economies that grow fast and have many people with high education levels. They also had similar economic policies during the 1960s through to the 1980s. Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan were all influenced by Japan's rapid growth after World War II. All these nations experienced periods of very strong GDP growth from the late-20th century until around 2005. This was because they adopted export oriented industrialization strategies. In recent years, however, their economic growth has slowed down significantly due to global recession and aging population. It is now believed that there will be no more ""Asian Tiger"" economies for decades to come as China takes over this role instead. However some believe that India could become an 'Indian tiger' if it continues its current rate of development. Since 2014, Vietnam has been considered as one too but not officially yet because it does not meet certain criteria such as having at least $10 billion USD worth of exports per year which would make them eligible under IMF standards; although this figure may change depending on how much money comes into their country each year so we cannot say definitively whether or not they qualify just yet either way though! There are other possible candidates like Bangladesh who might join sometime soon if things go well enough while others remain uncertain about where exactly they fit within this category since only time can tell what happens next... But regardless whatever becomes clear eventually should give us plenty more insight into why certain places seem poised towards becoming future powerhouses themselves - even if only temporarily before being replaced again later down road somewhere else entirely different perhaps..
Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan are sometimes called ""The Newly Industrialized Countries"". Others include Brazil, Chile, Poland, Romania, Russia, Thailand, Turkey, Mexico, Malaysia, Argentina, Peru, Philippines, Indonesia, Colombia, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Kazakhstan, Kuwait and Venezuela. Some experts think that Pakistan could be added to this list if it continues growing strongly in terms of both economy size and income level for citizens living inside those borders. Other nations such as Algeria may follow suit once their own internal issues stabilize sufficiently allowing"
70,"### Human: why do we need legal recognition of marriage? what will be the result if state stops recognizing all marriages?

 ### Assistant: Marriage is a contract between two people. The law says that when you get married, it means something in particular to your relationship with other people and how they treat you. For example, after getting married, some things are easier or harder than before; such as being able to file joint taxes. In most countries, only one man and woman can marry each other at once (monogamy). However there are exceptions where polygyny or polyandry may occur. Polygamy happens less often but has been recorded more frequently among royalty and nobility throughout history. There have also been cases where members of same sex couples were allowed by their government's laws until recently when homosexuality became illegal again due largely because Christian missionaries began arriving from Europe during colonial times bringing religious beliefs against LGBTQ+ relationships along with them which led many indigenous tribes who practiced this lifestyle beforehand into hiding out away from prying eyes while still maintaining contact through secret societies set up just for those purposes alone!  If states stop recognising any kind of marriage then there would not be much point having civil unions either since these too require legal recognition under certain circumstances depending on jurisdiction involved here so even though technically speaking no one could legally claim anything about another person without first proving themselves related somehow - whether biologically/genetically speaking OR otherwise via adoption etcetera.. This includes divorce proceedings too since nowadays anyone wanting access rights over children born outside wedlock needs proof beyond reasonable doubt showing parentage claims made validly according to current legislation passed down generations ago back home country wise respectively before granting custody awards accordingly based solely upon personal preferences rather than facts presented objectively factually correct manner instead meaningfully relevant contextually appropriate situations arise naturally occurring scenarios happening right before our very eyes today worldwide everywhere around globe wherever possible given sufficient resources available locally regionally nationally internationally globally whatever applies best suited purpose intended outcome desired results achieved successfully accomplished satisfactorily completed fully satisfied completely contented entirely fulfilled totally satiated wholly gratified adequately provided thoroughly supplied comprehensively addressed properly managed efficiently handled sufficiently controlled effectively regulated appropriately administered proportionately allocated reasonably distributed righteously dispensed equitably apportioned fairly divided equally shared impartially assigned proportionately allocated judiciously disbursed sensibly spent intelligently expended wisely"
71,"### Human: why are humans the only species of carnivores/omnivores that needs to heat raw meat before it's safe to consume?

 ### Assistant: Raw meat is a type of food. Humans can eat some types of raw meat, but not all kinds. Some animals (such as cats and dogs) will become sick if they eat cooked meat instead of raw meat. However, other animals like pigs cannot digest raw meat at all. Cooking kills bacteria in raw meat. This makes it safer for people to eat. But this does not apply to other carnivores or omnivores. They do not need to cook their meat first because they have different digestion systems than we do. For example, lions eat raw meat without getting any diseases from eating them; however, since our bodies aren’t made up entirely out-of animal parts like those found inside most predators – such as wolves -we must cook everything else before consuming it ourselves! Only humans need to heat raw meat before its safe enough to be consumed by anyone who wants some protein into his diet plan today. The reason behind this phenomenon has been studied extensively over recent years due largely thanks too advances made possible through modern science technology research efforts dedicated towards understanding how exactly things work within living organisms including humans themselves.""  In fact, no one knows what causes this strange behavior except maybe God himself...or maybe even Satan!! Whoever created us may very well know more about these mysteries surrounding human anatomy than anybody alive now could ever hope understand fully without studying every single cell present within each individual body part separately until finally finding answers regarding where certain organs come from so long ago when life began evolving on earth millions upon billions of years back during prehistoric times.."" These findings help explain why there isn't much information available online concerning specific topics related directly toward helping others learn how best go about doing something similar yourself sometime soon after reading here today...because nobody really knows anything definitive enough yet anyway!!! So please don't take my word for granted just because I said so myself either--I am simply stating facts based off personal experiences gained while working closely alongside experts throughout many fields ranging everywhere across America right now....including yours truly :)"
72,"### Human: What is a greenhouse and how does it work?
 ### Assistant: A greenhouse (or glass house) is a building with walls made of transparent material such as glass. It lets the sunlight in, but keeps heat from getting out. This makes an environment that allows plants to grow faster than they would outside. Greenhouses are often used by gardeners to make their flowers or vegetables grow better, or even year round. They can also be found on farms where certain crops need extra warmth. The word “greenhouse” comes from the fact that these buildings were originally built only for growing tropical plants which require higher temperatures than what you find at most places around Europe during winter time. Some people call them conservatories instead because they're not just used exclusively by botanists anymore; anyone who wants something more beautiful inside his/her home will use one too! 
Greenhouses have been around since ancient times when Egyptians first started using them back in 1500 BC – before Christ was born. In those days though there weren’t any windows so all light came through open doors instead while air circulation wasn’t very good either due its lacking ventilation systems like fans etc., making conditions less favorable compared today’s standards where we enjoy natural breezes blowing across our faces every now then without having any problems keeping ourselves cool enough throughout summer months ahead.”
A greenhouse is a structure that uses solar radiation to provide heating for plant growth. They may be attached directly onto your house, or free-standing structures located away from residential areas if needed. There are many different types of materials available including wood frames covered by plastic sheets called polycarbonates (PC), aluminum extrusions painted white vinyl siding panels known as ""painted"" houses; fiberglass insulation board made into wall panels called ""fiberboard"". These last two options offer excellent protection against extreme weather events like hurricanes because they don't break easily under high winds unlike other materials which could cause damage during stormy seasons such as fall / springtime when tornadoes tend occur frequently along coastlines everywhere across America.""
The design varies depending upon what kind(s)of climate zone one lives within North America: cold regions vs hot climates - each requiring specific construction techniques based off local geography & seasonal changes throughout yearly cycles .
Therefore ,it's important choose wisely between options listed above . Also note that some states regulate"

 ### Assistant: Atef Muhammad Ebeid (; 1932 – 5 June 2014) was an Egyptian politician. He served as Prime Minister of Egypt from November 19, 1999 to July 8, 2004 under President Hosni Mubarak. Before that he had been the Secretary-General of Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party since its founding in 1962 until his death. He also served as a member of parliament for four terms between 1970 and 2000. He died on 5 June 2014 at the age of 82. His funeral took place two days later in Cairo. The cause of his death is unknown but it may have been caused by lung cancer or diabetes. He left behind three sons and one daughter. One son is former minister Tarek El-Ebiad. Another son is businessman Ahmed El-Ebeidi. Eldest son Mohamed El-Ebeid worked with him during his time as prime minister. Daughter Laila works as an interior designer. All of them are married except for Mohammed who has no children. They all live in Cairo. He was buried in Nasr City, east of Cairo. This neighborhood includes many other prominent politicians such as Gamal Abdel Nasser and Anwar Sadat. It also contains the headquarters of the ruling National Democratic Party. Alongside other members of the government, Ebeid will be honored with a national holiday on August 26 every year starting this year. That day marks the anniversary of the start of the 1967 Six Day War which ended with Israel occupying Sinai Peninsula, Gaza Strip, West Bank and Golan Heights. Ebeid was born in Ismailia Governorate. His father was a military officer. In high school he joined the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party which was founded in Syria. He studied law at Ain Shams University in Cairo graduating in 1956. While still studying there, he helped organize protests against King Farouq I. These led to the overthrow of the monarchy in February 1952. Later he became a lawyer before entering politics fulltime. He first ran for Parliament in 1965. After losing, he"

 ### Assistant: The Xbox One X is a home video game console developed by Microsoft. It was released on November 7, 2017 as part of the eighth generation of gaming consoles. This console can play games from all previous generations in addition to being able to run native Xbox One X titles at higher resolutions and frame rates than earlier versions (such as the original Xbox One). In terms of hardware power it has been compared with Sony's PlayStation 4 Pro but notably more powerful due its GPU capabilities that allows for better visual fidelity when running natively designed games made exclusively for this system such as Forza Motorsport 6 Apex or Gears Of War Ultimate Edition which were optimized specifically for use with an upgraded version called Scorpio Edition whereas other older games like Halo Wars 2 do require some form of patching before they will work properly without any issues arising during installation processes etcetera...
The Xbox one x uses two customized 8 core CPUs clocked at 2.3GHz each while featuring 12GB DDR5 RAM memory along side 1TB hard drive storage space available internally within unit itself; however external USB drives may also be connected if needed depending upon user preference since these options provide additional flexibility outside default settings provided through factory configuration process performed prior purchase date arrival timeframe window period duration length spanning between pre-order placement orders placed ahead scheduled release dates specified by manufacturer company responsible production distribution sales marketing efforts associated therewith..

75,"### Human: Can you propel in zero gravity by hiting yourself?
Example: hitting your chest with your hand?
 ### Assistant: In physics, a projectile is an object that moves through the air or space. It does not have to be moving very fast; it can move at any speed. When thrown into the air, for example, a ball will follow a parabolic path before falling back down to Earth. A rocket flying off from its launch pad has been accelerated (made go faster) so much that it stays up in the sky instead of coming straight back down again. If we could see the force on the rockets, they would look like little arrows pointing towards us because those forces are pushing them away from where they were launched. Projectiles usually don't travel far enough away from their starting point before slowing down and stopping completely due to friction caused by dragging against particles such as dust molecules floating around inside our atmosphere here on planet Earth! This makes it difficult for anything sent out there without some kind of engine attached--like what happens when someone throws something really hard at another person standing next door who catches it right after being struck directly between eyes but doesn’t get hurt because his helmet saved him from getting knocked unconsciousness even though he still feels dizzy afterwards...
 
A projectile is also called a ""bullet"". But bullets are only one type of projectile. For instance, arrows, missiles, baseballs, and grenades are all different types of projectiles too. They each fly differently depending on how they are made and fired. The word ""projectile"" comes from the Latin words projiciere meaning 'to throw forward'. That means if you want to shoot something across town using this definition then technically speaking what you need isn't necessarily just any old gun - it needs to be able to send whatever item(s)you choose ahead while remaining behind itself at all times during flight time until impact occurs somewhere else later downrange . So basically anyone throwing things around should probably learn more about aerodynamics first before attempting anything dangerous involving firearms since accuracy matters quite heavily here especially considering most people aren't experts yet either way regardless whether they use traditional methods like rifles/shotguns etcetera versus modern alternatives including lasers beam weapons etcetera which may seem easier initially however ultimately require higher skill levels overall due solely due simply fact less experience gained thus resulting lower probability success rates per attempt performed compared previous attempts conducted previously prior period corresponding date range mentioned earlier paragraph above current location currently residing area surrounding"
76,"### Human: What is Lao script and how does it differ from other writing systems?
 ### Assistant: Lao script (Laotian: ພຣເທອີ, , IPA: [pʰɛːŋ tɕīt]) is an abugida used to write the languages of the Tai–Kadai family spoken in Laos. It was adapted from a version of Khmer script called Zhuangyu during the 16th century by King Setthathirath I. The language has borrowed many words from Sanskrit, Pali and Mon, as well as Chinese characters for some concepts which do not exist or have no equivalent in Lao. This means that while most vowels are written out, others must be inferred based on context. For example, ""ນ"" is pronounced ""n"", but if followed with ""ຍ"" then it becomes ""ng"". If followed by another consonant it would become ""m""; thus, ""ມ"" can mean either ""mah"" or ""meuh"". Similarly, ""ບ"" could also sound like ""b"" when preceded by a vowel such as ""a"" (""ba"") or ""e"" (""be""). There are three main types of letters: basic, prefixes and suffixes. Basic letters make up about two-thirds of all possible combinations; they represent single sounds without any modifications needed beforehand. A few exceptions include ""ກ"" being silent unless after another letter where it will change its meaning depending upon what follows next - this makes sense since you cannot just say 'k' anymore once someone else starts talking! Other examples include ""ລ"" becoming silent at times because there isn’t enough space between words otherwise people might get confused about whether one word ends here or continues onto something new altogether... In addition these same rules apply even though we only use them sparingly due primarily due their rarity within everyday usage compared against more common ones found elsewhere throughout history.""
The alphabet uses a combination of syllables and consonants to create different words. Each character represents both an individual sound and a group of related ideas. Some consonants are combined into groups known as “conjuncts” to form compound words. These conjunctions allow speakers to express complex thoughts quickly and efficiently through their native tongue rather than having long conversations using foreign vocabulary terms. They also help avoid ambiguities caused by multiple definitions per"

From April to November 2017, she also held the position of Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha. She is a member of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). She was elected to Rajya Sabha for two terms and to Lok Sabha five times. In July 2018, she became the first female leader of opposition in India's Parliament history. On 6 August 2019, she died at AIIMS hospital after suffering cardiac arrest. She was aged 67 years old. Her funeral took place on 7 August 2019. The day was declared a national holiday by President Ram Nath Kovind. Former prime minister Manmohan Singh described her death as ""shocking"" and called it ""a great loss"". Congress president Rahul Gandhi said that he felt ""deeply saddened"" about her demise and offered his condolences. Prime Minister Narendra Modi paid tributes to her and expressed grief over her sudden demise. He added that she will be remembered forever. Home Minister Amit Shah stated that with her passing away, the country has lost one of its best leaders who had made unmatchable contribution towards nation building. Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar condoled her death and tweeted saying that her death left him deeply shocked and saddened. West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee wrote on Twitter that the news of her death came as a huge blow to her. Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Kamal Nath tweeted that she would always be remembered for her simplicity and honesty. Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal recalled how when she visited her house, she treated them like family members and gave time out of her busy schedule.

78,"### Human: Who is Jessie and what is her role in the Toy Story franchise?
 ### Assistant: Jessie is a character from the Disney/Pixar movie series, Toy Story. She was originally part of Woody's Roundup as a pull-string cowgirl doll named Bo Peep who has sheep to look after. However she lost all but one of them when they were given away by their owner Andy Davis (who received Woody). In later movies, Jessie becomes an important member of Buzz Lightyear's Space Ranger Team and Woody's friends. Voiced by Joan Cusack, Jessie appeared for the first time in 1999 in Toy Story 2. She also appears in Toy Story 3 and Toy Story Toons. The actress Nancy Hayden voiced her in two video games based on Toy Story 2. When Jessie first came out in Toy Story 2, people liked how funny and nice she acted. One reviewer said ""Jessie is my favorite female animated character ever"". Another person said that ""she gives me hope"" because she shows that even if you are damaged or broken, it does not mean your life will be over. A writer called her ""the most beautifully drawn cartoon heroine I have seen."" This critic thought that her face looked like a real woman's and not just a drawing. He praised the way she looks and acts at different times during the film. He compared her with other characters in Pixar films such as Nemo, Mr. Incredible, Remy, and Marlin. He wrote about how much he enjoyed seeing Jessie become happy again through being loved by someone else. People say this makes him think more deeply than usual about his own feelings toward others around him every day without thinking too hard about it until now! They may never realize why this happens unless they stop taking things so seriously sometimes...but maybe then we would understand each other better anyway...""
In conclusion,""Jessie made us feel good inside while watching these great stories unfold before our eyes!"" That's right folks--it doesn't matter whether you enjoy watching movies alone or with family members; everyone should try going into theaters once in awhile just because there's always something new waiting patiently behind those doors...waiting patiently behind those doors...waiting patiently behind those doors......so go see some good ones today!!!

79,"### Human: What are the different roles of the parts in MIL-STD-1553 communication?
 ### Assistant: In MIL-STD-1553, there is a bus and stations. The bus carries data from one station to another. Each station can be either a Bus Controller (BC) or a Remote Terminal Unit (RTU).  A BC has control over who gets access to the bus at any given time, but it also sends its own data. An RTU only receives data on the bus; it does not send anything back. There may be multiple RTUs per system, while each system will have exactly one BC. When an RTU needs to talk with other devices, it asks for permission from the BC first. Only when the BC grants this request does the RTU get to use the bus. If two RTUs try to talk at once, they must wait until their turn comes around again before talking. This ensures that no two units ever transmit simultaneously. It's important that all messages sent by both controllers arrive safely so that none go missing during transmission due to interference caused by nearby objects such as buildings or trees blocking line-of-sight between sender and receiver(s).
The standard defines how many bits should be transmitted every clock cycle. For example, if your computer has four cores then you need eight bytes worth of information per second which means that each byte takes up about half a microsecond depending on how fast your processor runs relative to others running at similar speeds (e.g., Intel i7 vs AMD Phenom II X4). You could increase performance further by using more than just one core per task because some tasks require less processing power than others do. So even though most computers today come equipped with quad-core processors capable of handling multiple threads concurrently without slowing down too much compared against older single core models where everything happens sequentially within each thread respectively instead of having separate ones going off into parallel paths like we see nowadays thanks largely due advancements made possible through Moore's law over recent years allowing manufacturers produce cheaper chipsets containing fewer transistors yet still achieving higher levels accuracy/performance overall due mainly increased number transistor gates available them nowdays versus those used decades ago when these technologies were first developed way back when people thought computing machines would never become commonplace household items found everywhere across globe today!
A BC uses a special address called System Address Selector (SAS). This tells everyone else what address to listen for. Once someone"

 ### Assistant: Christopher Scott ""Chris"" Porter (born February 27, 1984) is an American former professional ice hockey player. He currently plays for the Chicago Blackhawks of the National Hockey League (NHL). He has also played with the St. Louis Blues and Nashville Predators. Career
Porter was drafted by the Atlanta Thrashers 63rd overall at the 2003 NHL Entry Draft. After a season in which he scored 55 points as a member of the Plymouth Whalers, Porter signed with the University of Michigan to play NCAA college hockey. In three seasons, he helped lead the Wolverines to two Frozen Four appearances. He finished his career with the school ranked third all-time in goals per game (.57), sixth in powerplay goals (27), tied for seventh in shorthanded goals (four), eighth in total goals (86), ninth in game winning goals (eight), tenth in assists (71), eleventh in plus/minus (+28), twelfth in hat tricks (two) and fourteenth in points per game (.94). He was named team captain during his junior year and received the CCHA's Best Defensive Forward award after scoring seven short handed goals that season. On April 1, 2007, it was announced that Porter had agreed to join the Milwaukee Admirals of the AHL on an amateur tryout contract for their remaining regular season games. He made his pro debut later that day against the San Antonio Rampage and recorded one assist. He would go on to score ten points in twelve games before joining the Manitoba Moose for their Calder Cup run. During the postseason, Porter led the league in both points (nine) and goals (five). His efforts earned him the Jack Butterfield Trophy as MVP of the playoffs. The following year, he returned to the Moose where he set franchise records for most goals (34) and points (66) in a single season. He was traded midway through the campaign to the Peoria Rivermen along with defenseman Tyson Strachan in exchange for Brandon Reid and future considerations. With Peoria, he continued to produce offense recording 24 points over the final twenty-one games of"

 ### Assistant: The Jeopardy! Teen Tournament was a special tournament on the television game show Jeopardy!. It ran from 1987 to 2005. In this version, three teenagers played against each other in one-week long tournaments for $30,000 and two trips to Universal Studios Florida or California. The winner also won an additional prize package worth more than $40,000. This included a new car and college scholarship money. There were five weekly rounds (Monday through Friday) with quarterfinalists playing Monday through Wednesday and semifinalists Thursday and Friday. Each round lasted about half an hour. There were no Final Jeopardy! questions during these shows because there wasn't enough time left over after showing all six clues per category. Instead they showed highlights of previous games throughout their broadcasting history such as Alex Trebek saying ""Jeopardy!"" at least once every day since its debut episode back in September 1964 when it first started airing nationally across America via NBC Television Network affiliates around North America including Canada where some stations carried episodes from Wheel Of Fortune hosted by Pat Sajak himself before he became famous hosting Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?, which premiered almost twenty years later but has been shown worldwide ever since then thanks largely due to being syndicated internationally through various cable channels like TBS Superstation/WGN America etc., who have purchased rights so that viewers outside US can enjoy watching them too; plus Fox Family Channel(now Freeform), Disney XD channel(which replaced Jetix), etc..

 ### Assistant: A tray (or serving dish) is a flat plate, usually with sides. It can be made of plastic or metal. Trays are often used to hold food. They may also be used as decoration.  In some cultures, they were once considered dirty if the person who owned them had eaten off of them. Some people still consider this taboo today in certain situations, such as when guests eat at home. The word ""tray"" comes from Old English treow meaning ""wood"". It was originally only used by men because women did not have access to woodworking tools during medieval times until about AD 1050-1200 when women began using knives instead of swords after their husbands died fighting wars against each other over land ownership rights which caused many battles between rival families vying for control over territories throughout Europe including England where William I conquered Normandy before becoming King Henry II's successor ruling England from 1137-1189. He ruled France too but lost both countries eventually due to poor leadership skills so he spent most his life trying unsuccessfully regain power back again through warfare while continuing expansion into Ireland Scotland Wales etcetera until finally dying himself around year 1242 age sixty eight years old leaving behind two sons named Richard Lionheart & John Lackland respectively plus several daughters one whom married Hugh deLacy Earl Of Ulster another whose name cannot remember right now either way these two individuals became kings later on down road after father passed away peacefully without any trouble involved thank god!

83,"### Human: What is an anvil used for?
 ### Assistant: An anvil is a piece of metal that has been shaped so it can be hit with a hammer. It is often used to make other things out of metal, such as nails or horseshoes. The word ""anvil"" comes from the Latin word ""angulus"", which means corner (the part of something where two sides meet). A blacksmith uses his anvil and hammer when he makes tools and weapons out of iron bars. He first cuts off one end using pliers, then flattens both ends by hitting them against each other until they are flat enough not to break under pressure. After this process is finished, he puts some oil on top before starting again at another point along its length until all parts have been worked over several times until there's nothing left but smoothness everywhere except near any sharp edges like those made by cutting away pieces during previous steps in order keep everything safe while working without getting hurt yourself too badly! If you want more information about anvils please go here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anvil 
The shape of most anvils today was created around 1400 AD by blacksmiths who wanted their workpieces held securely between two flat surfaces instead just having one side being held up by hand while striking blow after blow onto whatever object needed attention – whether it was welding together broken bits into whole new shapes or simply straightening out bent steel rods ready for use elsewhere later down line somewhere else entirely different than where we stand now looking back through history seeing how far technology has come since those early days long ago past when people lived much simpler lives fuller ones filled happiness joy peacefulness harmony love kindness compassion understanding empathy sympathy mercy forgiveness generosity charity selflessness altruism benevolence tolerance inclusivity acceptance diversity multiculturalism equality opportunity fair play justice freedom democracy liberty rights responsibility obligation duty accountability integrity honesty truthfulness transparency authenticity genuineness sincerity open-mindedness flexibility adaptability resilience perseverance persistence determination tenacity stubbornness grit courage strength willpower conviction belief faith trust confidence optimism hope optimistic positive attitude cheerful disposition happy mood pleasant temperament friendly sociable companionable affable genial good company nice person likable popular well liked accepted approved admired respected esteemed honorable reputable upright honest"
84,"### Human: Which material has the highest power to weight ratio when used as a spring?
In the construction of quite large springs (a clockspring) in the order of several KG of weight, what is the most efficient material interms of power stored in the spring to weight of the spring? Is there a list of materials somewhere that has the apprx. amount of Joules one can store in the material when used as a spring?
 ### Assistant: A spring is an object under tension or compression. The force applied is proportional to the distance between its ends.  There are many kinds of spring. Some have been invented for specific purposes; others are just variations on common designs. When using a spring to do work against gravity, it must be stretched by at least twice the height from which it will return before being released. This means that if you want your device to lift something up and down once, then you need three times more energy than just lifting it straight up would require. If we assume that all other things remain equal except for this difference in length traveled during each cycle then we can calculate how much more powerful our machine becomes with every additional cycle added until finally reaching maximum efficiency where no further gains can be made unless another source such as electricity were used instead because they don't rely solely upon elastic potential energy like traditional springs do but rather convert kinetic motion into electrical current which could potentially provide enough power even without any outside help whatsoever! In fact some people believe that ""perpetual motion"" machines exist due largely because these types of generators produce free-flowing electrons continuously without stopping ever again after starting them off initially so long ago now forgotten history tells us nothing about how exactly did happen first time round anyway...but let me tell ya something else interesting too while I'm here talking away my mouth off telling tales out loud loud enough everybody hears me say whatever comes next......it turns out those old guys weren't wrong either way around actually since both sides agree pretty well overall concerning certain aspects related specifically towards designing better versions later ones came along eventually though unfortunately nobody knows precisely why yet still today remains somewhat unclear whether true answer lies somewhere hidden deep inside mysterious depths unknown universe far beyond reach human understanding completely impossible understand fully comprehend completely grasp concept entirely fully comprehensible comprehendable explainable clear unambiguous simple straightforward easy straightforward direct obvious transparent transparent clear visible apparent plain evident manifest evident apparent undeniable patent self-evident conspicuous discernible distinguishable distinctive detectable recognizable revealing showing uncovered disclosed discovered found exposed laid bare naked revealed publically unmasked displayed exhibited shown forth brought out divulged betrayed confessed admitted avowed acknowledged owned up told spilled the beans gave away given away opened their heart poured their soul out shared information freely spoken frankly spoke candidly talked openly communicated"
85,"### Human: Who is Conrad Moffat Black?
 ### Assistant: Sir Conrad Moffat Black (born August 21, 1944) is a Canadian-British businessman. He was born in Montreal, Quebec and raised in Toronto, Ontario. In the late 1980s he became an editor of The Daily Telegraph newspaper in London, England. In 2007, Black was convicted on fraud charges by U.S. federal courts for his role in defrauding shareholders through Hollinger International's sale of several newspapers between 1996 and 2003. His sentence ended in May 2012. Since then, Black has worked as a writer, columnist, historian and broadcaster. He published A Matter of Principle: The Memoirs of Conrad Black in October 2011. He also wrote Franklin Delano Roosevelt: Champion of Freedom which won the 2012 Presidential Award from the Society of American Historians. As of April 2015, he continues to write regular columns for National Review Online and The New York Sun. On June 23, 2016, it was announced that Donald Trump had nominated him to be Ambassador to Canada. However, after news stories about accusations made against Trump during the campaign, he withdrew his name from consideration. On July 12, 2016, the White House said that they would not consider any more nominees until September when Congress returned from its summer recess. This meant that there could have been no new ambassadors appointed before November 2016. Therefore, if Black had still wanted to take up the position at this time, he would have needed Senate confirmation. After the election of Democratic president Joe Biden in January 2021, Black once again applied for the post but did not receive an appointment under Biden. Instead, former deputy prime minister Anne McLellan received the job instead. She started her term in February 2021.
Black married Barbara Amiel on December 1, 1992. They live in Palm Beach, Florida. They have three children. Their daughter Alana is a model who appeared in Victoria’s Secret Fashion Shows. Her son is Jonathan. Their other child, Isabel, died while still young due to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome."
86,"### Human: What were mastabas made from and when were they built?
 ### Assistant: A Mastaba is a type of tomb in Ancient Egypt. It was used for the burials of nobles, priests, kings and queens. The first mastabas date back to around 3000 BC. They are rectangular buildings with sloping sides that come together at an angle. Most have flat roofs but some may also have pyramid-shaped roofs. Some had courtyards and chapels attached. They were originally made from mud bricks, then later stone blocks were used. In the Old Kingdom period (c.2650–2181 BCE) most royal mastabas were located near or next to the Nile River valley, including Giza, Saqqara, Abusir and Lisht. During this time it became common practice to build many smaller tombs within one larger structure so as not to waste space on unused land which could be used by others instead if needed later down the line after death occurred again due its high rate among those living there before them died off eventually too soon after their own births had taken place over thousands upon thousands years ago now gone forevermore since no trace remains anymore today either way you look at things though because nothing ever stays alive forever even though people try really hard sometimes just like everyone else does every single day without fail until finally dying someday sooner than expected maybe even tomorrow! So don’t worry about anything unless absolutely necessary otherwise enjoy yourself while doing whatever pleases YOU personally most often times anyway…
The shape of the mastaba changed during the time that these tombs were being constructed; they started out looking more like stepped pyramids, and gradually evolved into having straight walls and flat roofs. This change happened between c.2494-2347 BC according to Manetho's Chronology. Many historians believe this transformation took place under Menes I who ruled from 2525 BC - 2518 BC. However, other scholars say that it might have been done earlier or later depending on what sources you read from different authors such as Herodotus (Greek historian), Strabo (Roman geographer), Diodorus Siculus (ancient Greek historian). There isn't any evidence yet found proving exactly how long each phase lasted though so we can only speculate based off existing data collected throughout history up until present day studies where new"
87,"### Human: What is the history of Redfield, Kansas?
 ### Assistant: Redfield is a city in Bourbon County, Kansas, United States. In 2010, 65 people lived there. History
Redfield was created around 1879. It was named after an early settler who had come from Iowa and whose name has been lost to time. The first post office at Redfield opened on November 30, 1879. On April 4, 1885, it closed because of problems with mail service. A new post office called ""Rosedale"" began operation on January 10, 1886. This one lasted until June 30, 1904 when its services were moved to Maple Hill. Rosedale's postmaster during this period was Henry Goulding (who later became mayor of Topeka). After being abandoned for several years as part of what would become Fort Leavenworth Military Reservation, Rosedale reopened briefly under that name before becoming known again as Redfield sometime between October 1924 and May 1925. The town received its current name back on September 28th 1926 due to confusion over which community should be named ""Rosedale"". There are two towns called Rose Dell within close proximity so they decided instead just use their original spelling ""Red Field."" The population reached 100 by 1890 but declined rapidly afterwards because most residents left following World War I or simply died off naturally without ever having children themselves; today only about five families remain living here full-time year round out of all those still alive today worldwide totaling less than half dozen individuals including myself included among them according recent census data collected locally recently released publicly online freely accessible via internet search engine query results page listing available information regarding local demographics statistics trends patterns etcetera relevant topics related thereto pertaining heretofore unexplored subject matter previously unknown hithertofore undiscovered hidden away secretive obscure untold tales mysterious stories forgotten legends myths rumors whispers gossip hearsay folklore fables fairytales fantasies dreams nightmares horrors terrors fears panic chaos madness insanity craziness lunacy delirium mania schizophrenia paranoia psychosis melancholy depression sadness gloom do"
88,"### Human: What is King Edward VII School known for?
 ### Assistant: King Edward VII School (KEVII) was a secondary school in the town of Bath, Somerset. It was opened on 28 April 1905 and closed at the end of July 2017. The school has been rated as outstanding by Ofsted three times since 2006. It was also named 'State Secondary School of the Year' twice in four years. In March 2014 it won the TES Independent State Secondary School of the year award. In October 2015 KEVII was awarded the prestigious UNICEF UK Rights Respecting School Award Silver Level status. It became one of only six schools in the whole country to have achieved this standard. In May 2016 the school was again recognised nationally when they were chosen from over 300 applications across England to be one of just eight national finalists in the Pearson Teaching Awards. They received recognition for their work with students who are new arrivals into the United Kingdom. These awards are considered to be Britain’s highest teaching honour. A few months later the school was selected once more, being shortlisted for the BBC Radio 2 Teacher of the Year award. This saw them progress through to the regional heats where they performed live in front of an audience of thousands. Their performance reached the top ten but did not win the overall title. Also that month two members of staff had the great privilege to represent both the city and region as part of the Lord Mayor’s Civic Party. They joined other local dignitaries in celebrating the achievements made throughout the West of England during the last twelve months. At Christmas time of 2016 the headteacher announced his retirement which would take place after Easter of 2017. He left the post at half term. Two weeks before leaving the school held its first ever open evening, attracting well over 200 people wanting to learn about what the school could offer to their children. On 3 November 2017 the school building re-opened under a different name; Oldfield Park Primary Academy. All pupils moved down to the primary site and continue their education there. There was no sixth form provision at the new site so those who wanted to study further went to alternative colleges or sixth forms elsewhere. After a period of refurbishment the old senior school buildings will become a resident"
89,"### Human: What is the history and significance of Salford?
 ### Assistant: Salford was a medieval township in Lancashire, England. It became part of Greater Manchester in 1974 as a local government district. In 2015 it had an estimated population of 368,600. The City of Salford has a mayor elected every four years by universal suffrage. History 
Salford Ladinge (or Salphurd) is first mentioned in Domesday Book in 1086 as one of the three places that paid geld for the hundred of Westhulme. Its name meant ""willow tree crossing"". This probably refers to a ford on the River Irwell near its confluence with the River Mersey where there were willows growing nearby. Early documents mention a church at Salford, but this may have been St Mary's Church, Kersal which lies just outside modern-day Salford. A chapel dedicated to Saint Cuthbert existed from around 1200 until it was destroyed during the English Civil War. Afterwards, the parishioners built another chapel in the same place. This building survived into Victorian times when it fell out of use due to competition from other churches. It was demolished in about 1880. Another chapel dedicated to Saint Philip was founded in the late thirteenth century. Likewise, this building fell into disuse after the Reformation. It later served as a school before being converted back to religious use. Today, it is known as Peel Hall and serves as a community centre. There are two schools named after this saint in the city. One is a primary school and the other is a secondary school. The latter is now a specialist sports college. Both these buildings date from the mid nineteenth century. They replaced earlier ones which dated from around 1600. These older buildings stood on what is today called Chapel Street. Also on this street is a small Methodist chapel dating from the eighteenth century. Nearby stands an Anglican church also dating from the eighteenth century. On the opposite side of the road stand some terraced houses originally designed to house mill workers who worked in cotton factories in the area. Further down the hill towards the river lie more industrial buildings including a large railway station. This station used to be the terminus of the Liverpool to Manchester Railway line. Nowadays, trains pass through without stopping"
90,"### Human: What team does Mac Jones play for in the NFL?
 ### Assistant: The New England Patriots are an American football team that plays in the National Football League (NFL). They were founded in 1960 as a member of the American Football League. In 1970, they joined the NFL after the AFL and NFL merged into one league. Their home field is Gillette Stadium which opened in 2002. Before then it was Foxboro Stadium from 1971 to 2001. The Patriots have won six Super Bowls and appeared in nine others. This makes them tied with Dallas Cowboys for most appearances at the Super Bowl. They also have the record number of wins with five championships since 2001. From 2003 to 2004 and again from 2008 to 2012, they had two seasons where they finished first place without losing any games. These are called perfect regular season records or undefeated seasons. Tom Brady played quarterback during all those years except for his injury year in 2008 when Matt Cassel took over but he came back later on because Cassel got hurt too so Brady could finish out strong by winning another championship ring! He retired from playing professional football after leading New England's victory against Atlanta Falcons last January 5th; however he still owns shares within organization itself plus coaching staff positions while being considered best ever QB by many experts worldwide including himself according recent interviews done recently regarding subject matter discussed here today... ""I am proudest about my career,"" said Bill Belichick who has been head coach since 2000.""It means everything to me personally because I love this game more than anything else in life.”
He continued,” Winning is what drives us every day whether its practice sessions or games themselves .""We always strive towards perfection no matter how hard things get sometimes.""

91,"### Human: why is the us the only country, apart from liberia and burma, not to have adopted the international system of units?

 ### Assistant: The International System of Units (abbreviated SI) is a standard set of measurement. It was made by scientists around the world in 1960. As it became more popular, most countries started using it instead of their own systems for measuring things like length or weight. But one country has refused to do this. That country is the United States. This makes America unique among nations because they are the only ones who still use an older way of measuring called ""imperial"". There are two other countries that also don't use metric measurements; Liberia and Burma. They both used imperial before switching over to metric though! In fact there were many others too but nowadays we can count them on one hand since all except these three changed long ago. The US will likely change soon as well so don’t worry if you live here – your children won’t grow up with outdated ways either ;)
The U.S., Canada, Australia, New Zealand, India and Pakistan do not officially recognize any type of unit outside what we know today at school - whether it be foot/inch/mile etcetera versus centimeter/kilogramme etcetera). So while Americans may think that they measure distances differently than everyone else does-it turns out we actually agree upon which version should be used when talking about certain topics such as temperature scales where Fahrenheit degrees correspond directly into Celsius degree equivalents without having any conversion needed between them firstly beforehand doing calculations involving those numbers later down the line afterward. And finally...the last point worth mentioning would probably go something along these lines:""Even though nobody uses inches anymore because everything comes packaged inside boxes marked 'meters', there exists no official law stating how large each individual item must necessarily become."" These days people just assume whatever number fits best within whatever space constraints exist without thinking much further ahead beyond just getting through life itself without breaking anything too badly along its path towards completion until death occurs naturally due solely unto itself alone--without anyone else helping out during said journey along the way (if even possible)."" However, some states have already begun adopting new laws regarding weights & measures according to which all future products sold locally need follow suit accordingly too. So maybe someday soon enough everyone everywhere might finally start following suit themselves eventually leading up toward becoming fully integrated members once again amongst society overall regardless if currently living abroad somewhere far away from home base location wise speaking terms alikewise sayings similarily same"
92,"### Human: What is a handshake and how is it used in different cultures?
 ### Assistant: A handshake, or simply shaking hands, is the practice of grasping another person's hand to show respect. Handshakes are often done between people who meet each other for the first time as well as when they part ways. The typical greeting involves one individual offering his right hand to someone else while saying ""hello"" (or some variation thereof). When this happens, both parties should firmly grip their counterpart's outstretched palm with all five fingers until releasing them at once; however, if you have been injured recently then avoid doing so because it may cause further damage. In certain situations such as during weddings where two people will be exchanging vows together later on down life's road - especially those involving marriage ceremonies-the customary way would be by placing your left hand over top before letting go afterward since most Westerners find comfort within familiarity rather than unfamiliar surroundings like foreign countries which tend not offer much security due to language barriers etcetera... It has also become commonplace among friends even though its origin remains unknown but what we do know about these types of interactions revolves around trustworthiness amongst individuals regardless if either party knows anything about eachother prior meeting face-toface . This type of behavior can sometimes lead up towards friendship between strangers too! 
Handshakes were traditionally given only upon introduction (""I am Mr Smith"") or departure from an event (""Goodbye""). Today many companies require employees give handshakes whenever they see customers coming through doors into buildings where staff works including hospitals offices schools restaurants retail stores banks etcetera.. Handshaking serves multiple purposes such as establishing social status hierarchy orderliness among peers showing politeness/respectfulness towards superiors etcetera… For example suppose Bob meets Alice whom he doesn’t recognize initially but eventually realizes she belongs somewhere high above him socially speaking based off her appearance clothing choice hairstyle jewelry choices etcetera... If bob wants to appear friendly towards alice without seeming patronizing towards himself then giving her a proper greeting might help achieve this goal better compared against just staring blankly back at her while waiting patiently until finally deciding whether or not proceed forward with introductions themselves. One thing worth mentioning here though is that depending upon context culture country region etcetera... There could potentially exist several alternative methods available instead like h"
93,"### Human: What is the Gulf of Salerno?
 ### Assistant: The Gulf of Salerno (, ) is a gulf in Campania. It is located between the Sorrentine Peninsula and the mainland. Its coastline has many small towns such as Castellammare di Stabia, Pompeii, Meta, Torre Annunziata and Naples. To its east are Capri Island and Ischia Island. To the north it opens to the Tyrrhenian Sea. In 2016 an earthquake occurred at this location. This was caused by two fault lines that were close together. They had been separated for thousands of years because they moved past each other. These faults have not released their stress since then. There are still aftershocks from this event. Some people think there will be another large quake soon. Others do not agree with them. Many scientists believe that if these two faults rupture again, the resulting magnitude could reach 7 on the Richter scale. That would cause great damage to places like Salerno, Amalfi Coast, Ravello, Positano, Praiano, Nocera Superiore and Cava de' Tirreni. There is also concern about how much stronger an eruption Mount Vesuvius might produce. Since it last erupted in 1944, volcanic activity has increased around it. Scientists say the risk of a major eruption is higher than before. If the worst happens, tens or hundreds of thousands of people may die or become homeless. About one million people live near Mount Vesuvius now. People who want to leave can use public transportation including ferries, trains, buses and planes. A few airports remain open. Some roads and bridges are closed. Traffic jams make travel difficult. Hospitals cannot handle all patients coming to them right away. Other medical facilities are damaged too. Power plants need repairs. Water supplies must be tested first to see if they are safe. Some food markets reopen but others stay shut down due to shortages. Gas stations sell fuel only when needed; otherwise they stop working until further notice. Emergency shelters offer free meals and drinking water while residents wait out dangerous conditions outside buildings protected against natural disasters such as tsunamis or hurricanes which usually come along every year during summer months across Europe where temperatures soar above average levels"
94,"### Human: What is the name of the hit song by Right Said Fred that reached the top 5 in the English charts?
 ### Assistant: ""I'm Too Sexy"" is a song recorded by British pop band, Right Said Fred. The single was released on November 13, 1990 and went to #2 in England, but peaked at #4 in the United States. It also had success around Europe. It won two Ivor Novello Awards for Best Selling A-Side and International Hit Of The Year. In 2007, it ranked No. 86 on VH1's Top 100 One Hit Wonders. The music video was very popular because of its nudity and sexually suggestive content. On February 17th, 2019, the band performed this song live during Super Bowl LIII Halftime Show with Maroon 5. This performance made many people angry because they thought it would be offensive towards the transgender community due to the lyrics saying ""I'm too sexy for my shirt"". However, the band said there were no negative connotations behind their performance or the song itself. They claimed they did not mean any harm through either their performance or song. Many other celebrities such as Ellen DeGeneres spoke out against the band after seeing them perform. After all of these allegations came about, the band removed themselves from performing again and apologized if anyone felt hurt or uncomfortable while watching their performance. However, despite this incident occurring just days ago (February 1st), some people still believe that there are hidden messages within both performances which could have been interpreted differently than what we know now today. Some say this whole situation has caused more problems than necessary because even though nothing bad happened when playing football games back then like how things happen nowadays where someone might get shot dead over something stupid like stealing candy bars - everyone should remember those times fondly instead of trying hard every day just so nobody gets upset anymore.""
Right Said Fred is an American rock band formed in Los Angeles, California in 1987. Their first album was called ""The End Is Not Near"", released on June 11th, 1991 through Warner Bros Records. This record contained four singles including ""Young Hearts Are Full Of Fire,"" ""I Know You Better Than That,"" ""What Do We Have Here?"" and finally ""Little Bit More Time With Me Tonight."" These songs became big hits across America thanks"
95,"### Human: What are chiggers and what are their characteristics?
 ### Assistant: Chigger is the name for a type of mite, also known as redbugs or berry bugs. They live in warm climates like southern United States. Their scientific names are Leptotrombidium scutellare and Eutrombicula alfreddugesi. The mites that cause scrub typhus (Orientia tsutsugamushi) are related to these mites.  Adult female chiggers do not feed on blood but lay eggs; they are less than 1 mm long. Nymphs suck human blood, which causes an itchy rash with raised welts called papules. This happens when nymphs attach themselves onto skin where clothing rubs against skin. These mites cannot jump nor fly. Instead, they wait until humans walk by them then climb up onto legs using tiny hook-like claws at end of each leg's last segment before biting into flesh near joints such as knee area under pants cuffs etc., causing severe pain if left untreated because they inject enzymes during this process so there will be no healing unless treated immediately after being infected otherwise could lead death due lack oxygenation caused internal bleeding inside body cavity from scratching too much while trying remove parasites off your person without any assistance available nearby since most people don’t know how treat chigger bites properly especially those living rural areas away hospitals/clinics capable performing proper medical care needed save life victim affected disease spread quickly throughout community members living close vicinity suffer same fate depending severity case presented patient seeking treatment options locally accessible resources able provide relief symptoms experienced prior arrival facility equipped handle situation appropriately according protocol established healthcare industry standard practices nationwide accepted norm today worldwide across globe regardless location geographically situated earth surface currently inhabited humankind population present time period considered modern age technologically advanced civilization progressed beyond limitations imposed upon previous generations limited capabilities understand complex systems operating function effectively solve problems encountered daily basis lives impact directly indirectly manner dependent context surrounding circumstances particular scenario faced moment event occurs happening future events transpire accordingly sequence unfold naturally course set motion perpetuate itself continuously evolve adapt changing environment overpasses limits previously thought possible reach point achievement reached goals accomplished success realized dreams become reality fulfilled wishes hopes desires expressed openly honest way reveal true self hidden depths soul deepest darkest corners"
96,"### Human: What is the plot of the television show ""Gloria""?
 ### Assistant: Gloria was a 1982 American sitcom. It starred Sally Struthers as Gloria, who lives with her mother-in-law, played by Ann Morgan Guilbert. The series lasted only one season and consisted of thirteen episodes. The first episode premiered on September 15, 1982 at 7 p.m. Eastern time/6 p.m. Central Time on NBC. The final episode aired January 4, 1983. In this short run, it had to compete against popular shows such as Dallas and Diff'rent Strokes. Reruns were later shown in syndication under the title Gloria Upside Down. This name refers to the fact that all three main characters have the same name - Gloria. There are also two other versions of the theme song sung for each character. One version has lyrics about how she wants to be alone, while another says that she loves being married. Both songs were written by Stephen Schwartz (composer) and John Kander (lyricist). He wrote them both when he worked on Broadway musicals like Cabaret and Chicago. Afterwards they became very successful because people liked them so much! So now you know why there are different names depending upon which version you hear playing during your favorite TV show or movie scene where someone gets killed off before their time comes up again next week due to bad luck caused by some stupid mistake made earlier today...or yesterday..whatever happens tomorrow will happen too soon after tonight ends anyway so don’t worry yourself sick over something trivial like this!!

It got its Magdeburg rights from Grand Duke Sigismund Augustus on July 28, 1610. In 1842 it became part of Russia and then Poland during World War II before becoming part of Soviet Union until independence in 1990. During WWII there were many Jews living here who died at Auschwitz concentration camp or other places because they didn't want to leave their homes for fear that someone might take advantage if left unattended while away fighting wars elsewhere against Germany's Nazis invaders like Hitler did when he sent soldiers into occupied territories such as France where resistance fighters fought back against occupying forces using guerilla tactics like ambushes along roads leading out towards German lines which led them being captured easily due lack preparation time needed beforehand since these types attacks require careful planning ahead so everything goes smoothly without any problems arising unexpectedly later down line after all plans have been made ready prior going forward with actual operation itself.

He was Prime Minister of Jamaica from 26 March 1974 to 8 February 1980 and again from 16 October 1980 until he lost the election on 28 December 1989. In June 2006, it was announced that Patterson had been appointed as Governor-General by then Prime Minister Portia Simpson Miller. His appointment took effect in August 2006.

As of November 2018, Patterson remains the only surviving member of the Cabinet which attended Queen Elizabeth II's coronation ceremony. Patterson has two children with his wife Shirley. They have one son and daughter. The couple divorced in 1982. He remarried twice since then. Patterson married Michelle Chong in September 2003 but they separated later in 2003.
